            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Excellent and moſt Uſeful Piece, ſo long deſired, and ſo much longed for by very many Eminent Pillars in the Church, as well as by multitudes of other diſcerning Chriſtians, is now made yours. But before you enter it, we hold it needful to pray you to take a few things in your way: not touching the ſuperlative worth of that bleſſed and glorious <hi>ſtarre (a),</hi> the Renowned Author of this Work,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> which you already have, in a little Tract of his <hi>Life and Death,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1651. Nor, concerning the <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of it, which is done by himſelf in his own <hi>Preface:</hi> but, ſomething by way of Premonition, and ſomething by way of <hi>Apology,</hi> for our juſt vindication, and your better ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>We are troubled at the many ſlips of the Preſſe, in theſe looſe dayes too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> common, We therefore firſt deſire you to correct with a Pen the <hi>Errors</hi> in printing, which you ſhall after finde noted, to make the ſence more facile, and your reading of it more delightful. The falſe pointings are moe, and more troubleſome than the noted faults, and cannot be particularly ranged <hi>inter Errata,</hi> but muſt be amended in the reading. The pages alſo are, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, falſe numbred. Theſe, (together with the Contents in the front of each page of the <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Hypocrites, without our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) gives us juſt cauſe to complaine that, what once by the like ſupine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and unfaithfulneſſe, befell <hi>the Holy Bible</hi> it ſelf, printed in 80 <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. wherein (among many other faults of that <hi>Edition</hi>) in ſteed of thoſe words in the 119 Pſal. <hi>Princes have perſecuted me, &amp;c.</hi> the words, in many Books of that impreſſion, ran thus, <hi>Printers have perſecuted me without a cauſe,</hi> is now become the ſad fate of this Book, and might well be the cloſure of it, if the Printer would do it and us right.</p>
                  <p>Our next Premonition concernes the publication, which hath not beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thus long delayed out of envy, or negligence; but, upon the Authors own ground, as deeming it unſeaſonable. Not that we feared (as he) the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of it by any ſupercilious or time-ſerving Cenſor (the uſual <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> of former times:) or, as thinking there is now no need of it; for, there was never more. But, obſerving the boundleſſe liberty taken up in theſe times of reigning hypocriſie, by every <hi>Rabſhekeh,</hi> and black-mouth'd blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, to reproach and revile not only the moſt eminent ſervants, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:63232:4"/> the cleareſt and moſt fundamental Truths of Chriſt, through the ſordid obſtetrication of every baſely-mercenary Preſſe; we could not ſatisfie our own diſcretions in publiſhing ſuch an elaborate Tractate in ſuch unhallowed Saint-ſeeming <hi>Dog-dayes.</hi>

                  <p>it being a kind of diſparagement to an Orthodox and grave Divine to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in print among the wild rabble of fancy-drunken ſcriblers; unleſſe ſome extraordinary emergency compel him to it.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, meeting the laſt year with a miſ-ſhapen Pamphlet, intituled <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie unmasked,</hi> containing <hi>Characters</hi> of ſeveral Hypocrites, (fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>Samuel Crook</hi> (that pretious name) and publiſhed, <hi>(craſſâ minervâ)</hi> by <hi>John Dolling,</hi> we could not but kindle at ſuch a mangl'd Piece, patcht up out of ſome imperfect notes, firſt ſurreptitiouſly purloyned, and then as injuriouſly diſmembred, and thruſt upon the World as the perfect iſſue of the Author. Wherein, that Publiſher hath dealt not unlike to <hi>Joſephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who firſt made money of him; and then, in ſteed of their Brother, returned onely his coat, (dyed in blood, as they pleaſed) unto their Father. Or, as the Sorcereſſe <hi>Medea,</hi> that being (for her wickedneſſe) forc't to flie, ſnatcht up, and cut her Brother in pieces, ſtrowing them in her fathers way, to retard his purſuit of <hi>Jaſon,</hi> who had, by her meanes, rob'd him of his <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi> So that now we held our ſelves bound to publiſh the whole as it was digeſted by the Reverend Author; whoſe Characters, by that imperfect Piece, were almoſt reduced to as much diſhonour, as <hi>Jezabels</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe, of which no more was left but the skull, the feet, and the palmes of her hands<note n="b" place="margin">2 Kings 9.35</note>, to know her by.</p>
                  <p>If any think this to be <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> let him compare thoſe Characters of the <hi>Natural, Moral</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Hypocrites of <hi>Dollings</hi> Edition, with theſe here publiſhed, <hi>ad verbum,</hi> according to the perfect Copy, and he ſhall ſoon finde, in many places, many lines together left out in that Pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Praying Hypocrite,</hi> and the <hi>Fained Lover,</hi> he hath wronged our Author yet more, by obtruding thoſe as perfect draughts, which are more imperfect than the other. For, he never fingered, or ſo much as ſaw the laſt and more perfect Copies of thoſe two Chapters. Therin, the induſtrious Author, upon a review, altered ſome things, and added more, either in the Title-leaf before each Chapt. or in the adverſe pages of each leaf (left blank for that purpoſe;) or elſe, referd to other notes formerly preached on thoſe ſubjects. All which are now orderly put together.</p>
                  <p>We leave therefore every one to conſider what regard is to be given to that Publiſher either in what He hath ſet forth already, or further inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth to his Reader, touching <hi>this,</hi> &amp; <hi>certain ſelect Sermons</hi> of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <hi>licenſed by the Vice-chancellor of</hi> Oxford, <hi>to be printed there:</hi> the rather, becauſe he acknowledgeth the <hi>full notes</hi> to be in one of our hands, and not in his.</p>
                  <p>Nor needeth any wiſe man to ſtumble at this; it being uſual with Depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators haſtily to catch up what lies in the way, although but an imperfect part, whereby they marre all by rending in pieces what ſhould not be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Hence, that they ſo get, doeth them little good; and, what they leave,
<pb facs="tcp:63232:4"/> is of as little uſe, untill the torn parts be again conjoyned, and the whole preſented together, which here is done.</p>
                  <p>And now we buckle on our Armour to obviate thoſe reflections which Envy, Incogitancy or Ignorance may ſeek to caſt upon this Work: Againſt which Ingratitude, we ſend out this little Apology, and Defence.</p>
                  <p>There is in it, ſay ſome, too great an affectation of Scripture-phraſe, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as, oft-times, the ſame Texts are again and again uſed, and urged.</p>
                  <p>So ſay they who care not for the Scriptures, nor heed the applying of them. Our Authour is indeed much in Scripture-language, being <hi>an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 18.24</note>: not out of affectation, but as apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe expreſſions to tranſcend all other; and, to let all men ſee wherein he moſt delighted, and how exquiſitely he could diſcern between the <hi>Waters of Jordan</hi> and the <hi>Rivers of Damaſcus</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">2 Kings 5, 12</note>. Therefore he drew ſo much out of the pureſt fountain, and ſo little out of the pudly rivulets of <hi>Plutarch, Seneca</hi> and other the moſt applauded Moraliſts. Somtimes he makes uſe of their ſayings, yet (no more than <hi>Paul,</hi> before him) ſeldome vouchſafeth them the honour to quote the particular places out of which he had them to ſhew how little weight he placed in them, and how far he was from oſtentation for being verſt in them, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> in all the learning <hi>of the Egyptians</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 7.22.</note>; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in Heathen Poets<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.33 <hi>Ex Menandro.</hi> Titus 1.12 <hi>Ex Epimenide</hi>

                  <p>And albeit he alledgeth the ſame Texts often; yet, very rarely, if at all, to the ſame purpoſe, and upon the ſame occaſion; but, for ſeveral and diſtinct uſes. Nor is it a blot, but an excellency, to be able to make moſt uſe of what is Excellent. The ſame Scriptures often afford variety of inſtructions; and therefore a greater multiplicity of apt applications; where a wiſe man hath the handling of them. <hi>All Scripture</hi> (ſaith Scripture it ſelf) <hi>is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16</note>. If then, our Authour who was <hi>wiſe,</hi> (ſtill <hi>teaching the people knowledge,</hi> and <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good heed to ſeek out,</hi> and <hi>to ſet in order many Proverbs</hi>

                  <p>But, ſay others, not only the ſame words, but the ſame things (for which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> many of thoſe Scriptures are brought) are often repeated, which makes the Book to ſwell in bulk beyond neceſſity or profit.</p>
                  <p>This exception is ſoon wip't off by this one conſideration, that even thoſe ſame things are ever produced to ſeveral purpoſes, and in a different manner. Or, it happeneth by reaſon of the affinity of the Subjects, whereof he treateth. There is ſo much likeneſſe and correſpondency between ſome ſeveral ſorts of hypocrites, that what is ſpoken of one, agreeth well enough to the other. Upon this account the ſame things may be again alledged; yet with variety of application. If then <hi>to write to you the ſame things, to him was</hi> not grievous, why ſhould it be irkeſome to <hi>you,</hi> for whom <hi>it is ſafe</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note>?</p>
                  <p>Therefore he doth this <hi>ex induſtria,</hi> of ſet-purpoſe, ſo often, as the cauſe required, that every part might be intire, without forcing the Reader to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy up and down to find out the meaning of one place by recourſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="tcp:63232:5"/> Every ſeveral Chapter and Character here is like <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, independent, although not inconſiſtent. Some of them are ſo large alſo, that every Reader will not, and ſome cannot go over the whole. And, to refer ſuch to another place, is but to vex them by putting them to a double labour, firſt to ſearch, then to compare the places ſought out, to pick out the ſenſe of what they were reading. It was therefore the wiſdome of our conſiderate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to make every piece compleat in it ſelf, that he who will not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read all, might not loſe his labour in reading but a part.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If any ſhould except againſt the whole, as ſavouring more of morality than of Chriſt: ſuch muſt be intreated to conſider that it is ſuch morality as the Spirit of God in Scripture teacheth; and ſuch as is within the verge of the <hi>two great Commandments of the Law,</hi> tending mainly to turne the inſide of Hypocrites outward, who, as the ſelf-juſtifying <hi>Ruler,</hi> ſuppoſe they have kept the whole Law, and call for more work; and look upon humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as deſpiſed Publicanes: that hereby they may ſee how groſſely they deceive themſelves and others. It is that Teſt of the life of Religion, wherein Chriſt himſelf ſpent the greateſt part of his preaching Miniſtry, for unm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hypocrites, and to give warning of them. In a word, it is (next to the making ſure of Chriſt) the moſt needful work of a Chriſtian to put himſelf upon the moſt diſcriminating way of Trial of his ſincerity, and upon the laying open of whatever hypocriſie is in him, that he may with more care and ſpeed bewayle and caſheire it.</p>
                  <p>Nor hath any man that knew our Chriſtian <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and envyeth not his high eſteeme in the Church, any cauſe to complain that he hath not ſaid enough of, and for Chriſt. For even ſuch as never had the happineſſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his preaching (wherein none ſought more to ſet forth and to extol Chriſt) cannot be ſuch <hi>ſtrangers in</hi> our <hi>Iſrael</hi> (if men of parts and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry) as not to take notice of that orthodox and exquiſite work of his, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten printed, and reprinted, entituled, <hi>A Guide to true bleſſedneſſe,</hi> in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man (of ſalt, and forehead) muſt needs acknowledge to the honour of God, his accurate pains, and more than ordinary dexterity in ſetting forth Chriſt in his natures, perſon, offices and works, as fully (though not in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lines) as any man taking liberty thus to object, hath done, or can do.</p>
                  <p>It is not requiſite, but would be very incongruous to go over the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith in a treatiſe of manners. But it is very neceſſary, and moſt profitable, that he who hath done the one, ſhould, if he can, adde the other, that ſo the rule of faith, and the power of godlineſſe may be advanced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This laſt (which we here offer to you) is his preſent ſubject, which the good Lord ſet on effectually upon you and us, that this famous and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly-honoured Lamp, as well as we, may the more rejoyce in that great day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in whom we cordially ſigne our ſelves</p>

For their ſakes therefore, who deſire to underſtand the difference between theſe parties, in their neereſt approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and reſemblances, I have taken in hand this work.

                        <hi>in whoſe ſpirit is no guile.</hi> Thus it pleaſeth the Lord to ſtile and acknowledge his children, not that they are perfectly purged from this leaven, but becauſe it prevaileth not in them.

Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie counterfeiteth grace in the wicked, weakeneth and diſturbeth grace in the regenerate; in them it ſerveth inſtead of grace; in theſe it ſhouldereth in with grace. If it be hypocriſie (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith) <hi>peccatum vultu tegere,</hi> not to be known of our ſinnes by our looks; we may well adde, with the ſame father, to be without ſome ſpot of hypocriſie is ſcarce incident to mortality. Hence Satan thinketh he hath ſomewhat to object, even to the beſt of men. For when he could charge <hi>Job</hi> with nothing elſe, he accuſed him of <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> and it had gone ill with that <hi>upright man,</hi> if God had not been his merciful Judge. Hence it is that we can the better look into the cloſe cabinet of the hypocrites falſe heart; we have that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight which <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had not; we our ſelves in our ſtate of nature have plowed with the ſame heifer. We have a counterpane of the ſame inſtrument, though by a grace in great part cancelled. But hypocriſie reigneth not in Gods children: Hence it is a character of the bleſſed and juſtified man, in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile, a true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> one of Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> is he, that is<note n="e" place="margin">Pſalme 73.1 and 125.4</note> 
                        <hi>pure and true in heart.</hi> Thus hypocriſie is among natural men, an hereditary; and (I may ſay) oecumenical diſeaſe; in men outwardly called, belonging only to the Church viſible, an epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſeaſe, common, yet adventitious, not of the nature of their calling; in the regenerate it is an ill humour, but not a diſeaſe or ſickneſſe, becauſe it prevailes not to overthrow the functions of ſpiritual life. Every man therefore in the world is either an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> or an <hi>hypocrite:</hi> Every man in the Church is either of Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of the <hi>devils</hi> army, but the Church hypocrite is of the<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 11.7</note>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 14</note> 
                        <hi>Aner, Eſhcol</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> helped <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they went for the ſpoile, and he for the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, as in <hi>Rome</hi> the wiſe Senators would not have the ſlaves diſtinguiſhed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> from free men, leaſt knowing their number they ſhould rebell: ſo the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers hypocrites to be concealed, leaſt knowing one anothers minde, they ſhould prove more dangerous to his party then all the infidels in the world; It were not for the ſafety of a State, that all thieves and traytors were acquainted one with anothers minde, leaſt where, as now they ſtand in awe of true men, and take part one againſt another, they ſhould joyn together to the prejudice and deſtruction of thoſe that are well affected.</p>
                     <p>For theſe and the like Reaſons the Lord vouchſafeth a connivance to hypocrites in the time of this life, ſaving that he bringeth to light now one of them,<note place="margin">Why at times the Lord diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth them.</note> and then another, as <hi>Judas, Simon Magus, Ananias</hi>) to ſerve, as malefactors unto the Anatomiſts, that by diſſection of ſome, the diſeaſe of many may be diſcovered, and the cure facilitated: Or as men uſe crows when they have killed them, to hang them up to make others afraid. For as concealed, they are <hi>nauſea Chriſti,</hi> the abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Chriſt; ſo diſcovered, they are <hi>vomitus Eccleſiae,</hi> the vomit of the Church.</p>
                     <p>And this is my intent in this whole Treatiſe,<note place="margin">Application</note> that by the diſcovery of hypocriſie in many particular kinds and ſubjects, we may all learn how to carry our ſelves as far as may be from the contagion of this ſin.</p>
                     <p>To this end, firſt, we muſt not haſtily call any man <hi>hypocrite,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Charge no man raſhly with this ſin.</note> till we ſee the beame in his eye; for that were to enter upon Gods Prerogative<note n="i" place="margin">Jerem. 17.10</note> who only knoweth the heart. None ſo ready to faſten this imputation on others, as they that are privy to it in themſelves. We uſe to ſay, it is ill halting before creeples, and women whoſe beauty is counterfeit, and honeſty juſtly ſuſpected, are ready to ſay others are painted, and to call whore firſt; Satan the arch-hypocrite charged <hi>Job</hi> with<note n="k" place="margin">Job 1.9.</note> diſſimulation. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63232:13"/> we ſee the world (whether out of ignorance, emulation, or malice) doth thus nip in the head all forwardneſſe of profeſſion. But I hope to ſhew that hypocriſie is moſt common and moſt powerful where it is leaſt miſtruſted. Not they that are <hi>white</hi> are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but they that are <hi>whited;</hi> not the fair, but they whoſe beauty is painted. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be an hypocrite, and thou diſcern him not, he abuſeth thy judgement of charity; but at his own peril, not thine; nay, it is a comfort to Gods party, and a token of good times when there are many hypocrites. When <hi>David</hi> proſpered and prevailed, the<note n="l" place="margin">Pſalme 18.14</note> 
                        <hi>ſtrange children</hi> (though fainedly) ſubmited themſelves unto him. The Cukoe and the Swallow are not the beſt birds yet few birds are better welcome, becauſe they give us the good time of the year; the evil and dangerous days are thoſe wherein vice pulleth off her viſor, when wicked men carry their condemnation in their fore-head, when they<note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>declare their ſinne as Sodom,</hi> and hide it not; in the mean time, as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced that<note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt was</hi> any way <hi>preached;</hi> ſo let us be glad that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in any ſort profeſſed. Let the hypocrite (if he will needs) condemn himſelf whiles he admoniſheth us. He is condemned of himſelf, becauſe (for his credit) he will not ſeem what he is: He admoniſheth us what we ought to be, becauſe he thinks it for his credit, to ſeem what he is not. The firſt is a ſecret confeſſion of his own wickedneſſe, the latter is a teſtimony unto goodneſſe, even from the enemy of goodneſſe. If her enemies commend and court her, let her friends and ſubjects both love and ſerve her.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe hypocriſie is ſo general (and as I may ſay generical) let us for our own ſafety<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 10.17</note>

                     <p>Thirdly, above all hypocrites abroad, take heed of the hypocrite at home.<note place="margin">3. Take heed of the hypocrite at home.</note>

                        <hi>Keep thine heart,</hi> therefore, <hi>above all keepings,</hi> and from this above all corruptions.

Hypocriſie is the devils dance, the <hi>Devil</hi> therefore may well lead the ring, which conſiſteth onely of his own children: It is <hi>Pompa diaboli,</hi> the Devils pageant, therefore well may he be the <hi>Choragus,</hi> the leader of it. The Devil, I ſay, is both the <hi>architect</hi> and <hi>archetipe;</hi> the firſt forger, and the prime pattern or idea of this Myſtery;<note n="b" place="margin">John 8.44</note> 
                        <hi>a liar, and the Father thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But we muſt ſever theſe Propoſitions, and handle them apart: Shewing, Firſt, how he is the <hi>chief hypocrite.</hi> Secondly, how he <hi>makes and begets</hi> hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>Touching the former, it is manifeſt, that howſoever from men we riſe to Satan to ſearch the fountaine of hypocriſie; yet from him to any other we cannot aſcend.<note place="margin">Firſt Satan the Arch-hypocrite His fall.</note> He corrupteth men, (as we ſhall hear) but who corrupted him? none but himſelf, not he that made him, for the Lord made all things good, and Angels in the higheſt degree of created goodneſſe; yea, of truth alſo; for in that<note n="c" place="margin">John 8.44</note> 
                        <hi>he abode not in the truth,</hi> it followeth that he was initiated and had his original in the truth: But from that truth he fell of his own accord and motion without any tempter, or devil to ſeduce him; from whence it ſeemeth reaſonable that God ſhould leave him and his curſed complices without any means of remedy, or hope of redemption, though the ſame God afforded favour to man who had been ſeduced by <hi>that evil one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being thus fallen from the integrity of his creation, and become an enemy to his Creator; he with his party of evil Angels,<note place="margin">His malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</note> attempted to ſet up a contrary <hi>Kingdom of ſin</hi> unto that of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>goodneſs;</hi> whereto not being able to draw any of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits which had not joyned with him in his apoſtacy; he (being confined to theſe<note n="d" place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2 2.

Finally, that his tentations might paſſe unſuſpected, unheeded, as the <hi>Arch-hypocrite,</hi> he covered them with fraud and diſſimulation: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o here the generation of hypocriſie; Satans envy at mans felicity begat malice; malice begat miſchief; miſchief required accuſation; accuſation demanded temptation, temptation called in hypocriſie. For if he ſhould have told what he was, whence he came, and whereabout he went,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. Zech. 3 Diſguiſing, 1. Himſelf.</note> he well knew he ſhould have received no better anſwer from man then he had from <hi>Michael our Prince: Avoid Satan, the Lord reprove thee Satan;</hi> he therefore diſguiſed both himſelf and his errand: <hi>Himſelf</hi> in the body of the Serpent, a creature, as in harmleſs ſubtilty more neer to man, ſo (by likelihood) in his mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of colours more ſpecious and delightful to the eye then the reſt of bodily crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. This inſtrument he managed, not as a trunk through which, but as the mouth by which he ſpake; he being as the ſoul, the Serpent as his body. Therefore the holy Ghoſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> taking him in this diſguiſe, ſaith of him, <hi>The Serpent ſpake, the Serpent was accurſed,</hi> and (by the Apoſtle) <hi>the Serpent beguiled Eve</hi> by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty. The Serpent ever ſince hath born that reproach, not only inheriting the hatred of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63232:14"/> man-kinde, but alſo in being an everlaſting embleme of diabolical malice and ſubtilty.</p>
                     <p>In like manner he diſguiſed his <hi>errand:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 His errand.</note> for coming to murther, it behoved him to lie; for he knew he could not murder man without his own conſent, and that muſt be woon with a colour of friendſhip. Wherefore he pretendeth greater care of our felicity then was in God himſelf; and what the Lord had (as ſhould ſeem) through envy concealed, he (as a perfect friend that ſlighted his Lords favour in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his fellow ſervant) came ſecretly to intimate: who would have dreamt of a devil in all this?</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, for being fleſhed with ſucceſſe of his firſt attempt in the fall of man-kinde,<note place="margin">Since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his malice and fraud.</note> though that pleaſed God to propound an antidote againſt this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unto the ſeed of the woman from out of the ſeed of the woman, yet he gave not over his curſed enterpriſe, but hath ever ſince endeavoured by the ſame Art to encreaſe tranſgreſſors amonſt men, and tranſgreſſions againſt God: Therefore he is ſaid (by our Saviour) to be a man-ſlayer, not in the beginning onely, but alſo<note n="e" place="margin">John 8.44</note> 
                        <hi>from the beginning;</hi> man is the perpetual object of his malicious aſſaults, and now the more hated, becauſe God ſhewed more love in giving his Son, not only to take<note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 8.31</note> 
                        <hi>delights,</hi> but alſo (in the fulneſs of time<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 2.16</note>) <hi>to take part</hi> with the children of men, Falen Angels, being for ever left forlorn.</p>
                     <p>This made him to ſet a work all his engines for the advancement of his damned party, and to make uſe of all his furniture for ſo deſperate a deſign, that he might be a Mediatour of death, (as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaketh) in oppoſition<note place="margin">In oppoſition to Chriſt.</note> to him that was to be the Mediatour of life. He therefore laboured, not onely to lead into captivity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſouls, but alſo to diſturb and diſtract all ſocieties of men. For it his task and trade to ſow diſſention in families, ſedition in States, ſchiſme in Churches. And here eſpecially he enforceth himſelf to<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 13.19</note>

                     <p>His ſtrength<note place="margin">1. Strength</note> conſiſteth in the ability of his angelical nature, which (though much empaired by his fall, as we may conjecture by what we loſt in <hi>Adam</hi> our ſelves, and therefore far ſhort of the power of elect Angels) remaineth too ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to encounter. By this, though he be not wiſe, yet he is exceeding cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nig and crafty to do miſchief,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in Pſal. 90</hi> Daemones vafri ſunt, non ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> ſubjecting his wit to his will; and of <hi>Daemon</hi> a ſpirit, becoming a <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> an evil ſpirit; by this he is able to inſinuate himſelf, not only into elementary bodies, as he did into the Serpents, but alſo into the cloſet of reaſonable ſouls. For though he knoweth not properly and directly the thoughts of mans heart, yet by many conjectures he can perilouſly aime at them, and by fantaſmes and familiar ſuggeſtions offer what he pleaſeth unto the view of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Unto this his native ſtrength is every day added the Armour<note place="margin">2. Armour</note> of experience, which by long uſe, as by much hammering, is more and more confirmed. What may not he now hope to effect upon us, who prevailed with our firſt parents, when they were wiſer, and himſelf a novice. And if a little tract of age and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe giveth us more inſights into humane affaires, muſt not he needs be more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then any Frier, who knoweth both his own ſins, and moſt of ours alſo; and is unto all wicked men, from father to ſon as wicked men, a ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>

                        <note n="m" place="margin">John 14.30</note>; as for the world it is his Arſenal of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,

                     <p>But his art in diſguiſing his malicious purpoſe, and in fitting his ſeveral tentations,<note place="margin">His arts in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing his tentations.</note> is moſt obſervable; herein his hypocriſie chiefly appeareth, and that he is the <hi>chief of hypocrites;</hi> For as his will to do miſchief is more, ſo is his wit; and as he hath more wickedneſs to conceive, ſo is he more cunning to conceale it. If all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites be actors, he is a very <hi>Roſcius.</hi> When he ſpeaketh a lie, then he ſpeaketh of his own (ſaith our Saviour); but it is either not as a lie; or not as his own. The lie owneth him, but he will not be ſeen to own the lie, yet he maketh it ſo much the more his own, by laying a counterfeit colour of truth upon that. An Angel of darkneſſe he is, but ſeldom ſo appears; nay, he <hi>transformes himſelf into an Angel of light;</hi> we muſt not imagin that he ſo ſeems by aſſuming any viſible ſhape, but by guilding over his ſuggeſtions, that they may ſeem and ſavour not of hell, but of heaven; not of diabolical darkneſſe and filthineſſe, but of angelical purity and light. If light be made to ſerve unto darkneſſe, <hi>oh how great is that darkneſs?</hi> Let us therefore take a view of ſome of his moſt noted and uſual artifices by which he both ſhrewdeth from, and inſinuateth himſelf unto thoſe whom he would deceive.</p>

Secondly, he accuſeth them as a Promotor. Thirdly, he tormenteth them as an Executioner. Firſt, he makes uſe of ſinne which is the ſting. Secondly, of the Law, which gives ſtrength to ſinne. Thirdly, of death and hell, which is the hire of ſinne and curſe of the Law; Elſe his labour were in vaine; for without ſinne no <hi>Law</hi>

Thus raging in the man poſſeſſed, he confeſſed Chriſt<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 8.29, 31</note> to be the Son of God, and after left the print of his malice in the drowned ſwine, not to give credit to that Doctrine, but to make it be accounted a doctrine of devils.

Thus he dealt with <hi>Saul, Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, Judas,</hi> not giving them time to bethink themſelves, but urging and precipitating them to a ſpeedy reſolution of ſelf murder, like the ſwine that were carried violently into the ſea.</p>

As Hunters, when the beaſts are hampered in the toile, come with their darts and inſtruments of death: For ſo Satan hath not only his nets, but alſo his darts; fiery darts, not onely inſinuating, but alſo commanding tentations; the former to win them into his power; the latter to exerciſe his helliſh power over them; the former to diſarme them of wholſom and timely fear; the latter to inſult over them, when they are now paſt hope.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when rage deprives him of reaſon, and fury drives him from his fence.<note place="margin">4. When rage puts him out of his fence.</note> For as men in deſperation forget their cunning, ſo doth Satan; when he ſaw that Chriſt began that judgement, whereby he was to be caſt out: his malice made him do that, which apparently tended to the prejudice of his kingdom in haſtening the death of him, who was by dying to deſtroy both death and him.

Therefore the ſanguine with a moderate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of melancholy to qualifie the motion of the blood, is commended as the temper that giveth beſt counterpoiſe, both to the humors of the bodie, and paſſions of the minde.

                     <p>The better part of a man is his ſoul, and the better part of a Chriſtian is this Spirit or <hi>new man.</hi> As it is meet therefore that Art (the rule of reaſon) ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature; ſo is it alſo meet that grace ſhould perfect both nature and reaſon. A man of a cheerful ſpirit, though ſomewhat corpulent, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth nimbly, becauſe he hath <hi>animam pro vehiculo,</hi> an active ſoul for his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; ſo a Chriſtians motion being from the ſoul of new life, is more then according to the activity of nature. As in evil the titillation is from ſenſe and appetite; but the reaſonable will conſenting, maketh it a vice: ſo unto good there may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination by nature; but the royal aſſent of the inner man maketh it a vertue. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations beare great ſway in humane actions; becauſe few men examine, fewer correct or croſſe them. Some naturaliſts have been very partial in behalf of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes. What will not he aſcribe to nature, who can finde in his heart to affirme, that a man unlettered by meer alteration of the temper of his braine, may come to ſpeak the Latin tongue?<note place="margin">Atque idem jungat vulpes, &amp;c.</note> But in the childe of God, with a new Lord, there are new laws: the Law of grace improveth natural inclinations, if they be good, keeping the ſame courſe upon better grounds; reproveth them if they be evil; ſhaping her courſe, not according to the winde, but according to the compaſſe. And as Sea-men have an art to catch a croſſe wind, and make it ſerve their turne; ſo the childe of God maketh happy uſe of bodily diſtempers; making choler ſerve unto zeale; flegme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to patience; melancholy unto contemplation; and lively blood unto ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>

If his horſe be gentle, he rides him; if jadiſh, he breaks him; if weary he can lead or drive him; if ſtark tyred, he can go without him. He that hath good legges findeth leſſe lack of an horſe, and where grace is in breath, natural parts are leſſe miſſed.</p>

Some men turn good ſo ſuddenly, that we may ſay, how came this new Religion to ſeize upon them? But the good humour laſteth not long, there is a dump and a damp coming after. The very flood it ſelf bodes an ebbe. Or if the beginning were more ancient even from the very conception; yet nature, like the firſt matter, hateth to be tied alwayes unto one forme. Her paſtime and recreation is in ſucceſſion, and viciſſitude, and that of contraries. Summer and Winter are not more ordinary, then to ſee a man out-live his good nature.

Time devoureth both himſelf and his iſſue, and whatſoever is bred of nature hath his worm in it ſelf.

But above all, the eye and hand of grace is neceſſary to keep nature in the right way, which if it have a diſpoſition to go, yet is ignorant of the end of the journey.

                     <p>Firſt, that all mens ſtrife is not alike, nor any one Chriſtians alike in all duties. Some, as ſmooth trees, are ſooner ſquared, yet the ax muſt paſſe upon them. Into a ſoft nature, grace ſlideth, ſinketh, ſoaketh; and is hardly perceived. And as fire in

                     <p>Secondly, though natural diſpoſition may remove ſome rubs, and prepare a fair way for grace; though it may give ſome encouragement and acceptance unto goodneſſe, though it may be both an ornament and an inſtrument thereto, yet there is always work enough left for grace: For no temperature of nature will free a man from ſelf-love, profaneneſs, and ſuch like ſpiritual diſtempers.</p>

                     <p>Thus in the field of graces, the one as a paſſenger picketh a ſallat, or culleth out a garland; but the other cometh, as the owner to mow down, and carry away the whole crop.</p>

They were not therefore true vertues, but vices bordering upon vertue, and attired in the outward habit of vertues that made ſuch a glittering glorious ſhew among the ancient Heathens; and at this day ſeeme, in ſome, to out-face the profeſſion of piety. For.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, what vertues can they be, that have for their fountaine reaſon unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? For though <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> allowed none for true vertues, but ſuch as were imprinted in the ſoul by God;<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, what vertues are thoſe, which inſtead in Gods glory (the aime of all good actions) have any other end, and eſpecially the honour of him that perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them? For where ſome Philoſophers (as the <hi>Epicureans</hi>

For what charity is it in a covetous man, not to ſue his neighbour at the Law, becauſe he will ſpare his own purſe? what temperance, to abſtaine from pleaſures to avoid expence? What fortitude, to endure labour, hunger, (what not?) to compaſſe profit? what prudence to whet his wits to make benefit of all the ways of gain? But above all ſhadows, the affectation of glory is moſt deceivable, and with many paſſeth for the very ſubſtance of vertue. Yet who ſeeth not, that if men abſtain from all exceſſe in natural delights, only to be well thought of, or (as thoſe that were wont to try maſteries) to <hi>gain</hi>

Pleaſure and profit are baits for baſe mindes; honour is the idol of noble ſpirits. Yet it is ſhrined no leſſe in a tub, then in a chair of State. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> were well met, when the one would be <hi>Diogenes,</hi> if he were not <hi>Alexander;</hi> the other would be <hi>Alexander,</hi> if he were not <hi>Diogenes.</hi> Each would have learned ambition of the other, but that his own pleaſed him better.

Here <hi>Plato</hi> cleerly won the ſpurs from all his Corrivals; yet ſo, that his writings were rather pleaſant to read, then powerful to perſwade, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine noteth.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> by degrees wan ground by their acuteneſſe in diſputation, auſterity in manners, and ſtrictneſſe of precepts. Of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> wiſely noteth, that they ſquared the level to the ſtone, not the ſtone to the level; that is, the rules of vertue to their notion, not their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the rule; making the pitch of Philoſophy, not what a man could <hi>do,</hi> but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they could <hi>ſay.</hi> Thus they ſeemed <hi>paratragaediare,</hi> rather to furniſh a ſcene, then to keep a School. From them proceeded thoſe prodigious, and barbarous paradoxes. As that no man being vertuous, is more vertuous; or, vicious, more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then another; that unto tranquility of minde, all natural affections, and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be quite taken away; that the way for a man to encounter or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline all troubles, is to kill himſelf, and ſuch like. This ſect after the former crept in among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> but wrought no better effect. For (as one well obſerveth) with the Greek eiterature, the Greekiſh levity alſo found entire into that maſculine people; and vertue vaniſhed into a winde of words. From thenceforth their actions were ſuch, as were rather to be talked of, then to be drawn into example. For neither <hi>Cato,</hi> with all his rigidity, was tolerant enough to reſerve himſelf for better dayes; nor tongue-valiant <hi>Cicero</hi> reſolute enough to keep the Common-wealth from falling (and that through his fearfulneſſe) into the power of the <hi>Caeſarians;</hi> nor <hi>Seneca</hi> (the <hi>Salamon</hi> of our moraliſts) with all his ſentences, wiſe enough to forbear that wealth which made his ravenous diſciple long to be his heire. Neither did this <hi>verbal</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy die with that age. Even in our days <hi>Philologie</hi> hath given the mate to real <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and the notions of vertue ſerve rather for ornaments of diſcourſe, then for utenſils of life. Who can endure to ſee him paſſe for a wiſe man, whoſe actions ſink as far beneath the vulgar in diſcretion, as he ſoareth above them in a theatrical pomp of ſentences? who can endure that in this light of heavenly truth, vertures ſhould be drawn (as nimph-like pictures) clad in witty moralities, naked of divine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments, as fearing the faſhion would change, and the world turn Heathen
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63232:26"/> again? Whereto theſe moraliſts ſeeme to lead the way, being ſo devoted to thoſe idols of Gentiliſme, that in manners they affect to be their apes; in precepts, their parrats? who then can wonder, that ſuch in Religion prove themſelves<note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 4.14.</note>

                     <p>Thus the hypocrite is <hi>civil,</hi> that he may not need to be Religious: the childe of God is civil, becauſe he is Religious. In the one civility is the the rival of Religion, in the other the handmaid.</p>

                     <p>Grace doth not beare children, and then put them out to nurſe, but affordeth the milk as well as the ſeed. Yea rather, it nurſeth them firſt, and after bringeth them forth; making uſe of good education, as of the womb, wherein they are prepared and formed unto the ſpiritual birth; and ſo they are commonly brought forth with leſſe paine and difficulty: Education without grace, proves but an abortive concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for it is grace which actuateth all means and inſtruments of goodneſſe; A bleſſing which the Lord, though ſometimes in his unſearchable wiſdome he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, yet ordinarily affordeth to the conſcionable care of faithful Parents. For, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> by hoſpitality lodged <hi>Angels;</hi> ſo theſe, by vertuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, entertain Angels fellows, <hi>heires of heaven,</hi> into their houſes.

Herein the ſpiritual generation reſembleth the natural; ſpiritual parents (indeed all natural parents ſhould be ſuch) can give but the <hi>body</hi> of Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but the <hi>ſoul</hi> of ſanctifying grace is by God only and immediately infuſed. The moment of this infuſion is hard to diſcern; for holy education, as it cheriſheth, ſo it obſcureth the beginings of grace; as we ſee in <hi>Timothy</hi>

But expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes us ſee, that as they who have reſembled dead Princes ſuppoſed alive, have been fit ſtales for rebellion: ſo this dangerous counterfeit hath given occaſion to profaneneſſe, to riſe up in armes againſt grace, and to carry away a great part of the world after deceitful illuſion; dangerous I may well ſay, both to himſelf and others. To himſelf, becauſe he ſetteth this as a bolt upon his heart, and uſeth it as a ſtrong fence to ward off Religion. He juſtifieth himſelf, and deſpiſeth true purity of heart, becauſe he ſeeth not that evil outſide in himſelf, which happily appeareth in ſome that make profeſſion. And becauſe he ſeemeth neer to the Kingdome of God, he never careth to come to it; being like a parallel line, that keepeth a ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the way of goodneſſe, but never meeteth with it. How can he go right toward happineſſe that neither diſcerneth of the way, nor followeth the true guide? For in the ſea of this world there is no good ſailing without the ſight of heaven, much leſſe toward heaven. He that hath earth, that is, earthly reſpects, alwayes in his view, doth but creep along the coaſt, and will never arrive in the oppoſite harbour. To others, becauſe he objecteth himſelf as a Paragon to the view of the world, to pull down the price of true piety. Let them compare with me (ſaith he, or Satan that ſets him to <hi>Job</hi>) ſuch as make ſcruple of an oath, or conſcience of the Sabbath; ſuch as cannot live without the Word preached, nor ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without private prayer. Thus as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians by counterfeiting the miraculous works of God, hardened the heart of that King; ſo this man by ſome reſemblances, of good actions without piety, occaſioneth many to contemn true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and to condemne the generation of Gods children. But if heed be taken, ye ſhall alwayes diſcover ſome fallacy or other in the compariſon.</p>
                     <p>For firſt he compareth himſelf with ſuch as make only a profeſſion of Religion, without the practiſe and power thereof. Here it is not hard for him to excel. For a mean trade practiſed with diligence, giveth more hope of thriving, then the beſt neglected through idleneſſe; and bad ſpices beaten, yeild more ſmell then the beſt, barrelled up. Let a Chriſtian profeſſor live where he will among civil men, Papiſts, Turks, Infidels, if he be not far better then they, he will be ſhamefully worſe. The experience is too frequent, and lamentable of this heavy curſe of God on idle and barren profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he compareth himſelf with ſuch profeſſours, in whom there is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious diſadvantage. Religion in many beginneth late; and hath to do with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions habituated, and confirmed by long time, or by looſe education: But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of civility begin betimes whiles nature is tender and fit for impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he ſhuneth the compariſon of the beſt, and (as a coward) maketh choice of a weak adverſary. And it is no marvel if <hi>civility</hi> get the ſtart lighting on wiſer heads, more active ſpirits, together with a more favorable aſpect of the times. For men do more willingly and mor in differently behold this civil ſhadow, then the ſubſtance of true piety. In them that are religious, even vertues are counted faults; but in men without conſcience, ſpiritual faults and defects are counted vertues. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Satan laboureth not either to interrupt with tentations, or diſgrace with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, men that live in a civil courſe, but rather cheriſheth this counterfeit, to confront piety; whereas in them that fear God, he ſtirreth up paſſions, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth them with injuries, to bring an ill ſavour upon their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Finally, to our corrupt and carnal nature, this humane diſcipline is more natural, then that of Religion; which propoundeth to correct nature, reaſon, cuſtom and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63232:32"/> all; and, to bring a man to that, from which nature is ſo averſe; that is, the diſlike, and deniall of himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe the Citizen of heaven <hi>maketh civilitie march under the ſtandard of Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He <hi>provideth for things honeſt in the ſight of God and man.</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 8 21.</note> But marke the order; Firſt, in <hi>the ſight of the Lord,</hi> and after in <hi>the eyes of men.</hi> Things of good report, and men, are his ſecondarie care. Even of thoſe, there is in him a truth and ſubſtance, which the hypocrite wanteth. In all things he deſireth his beſt and faireſt ſide may be inward toward God, and his own conſcience, for theſe are the beſt eyes to diſcern it. But he reſteth neither in outward civilitie, which may be in an hypocrite: nor in the truth of juſtice, and ſocietie, which makes him but halfe a Chriſtian. Piety toward God is the Queen of vertues, and all muſt come under her command, without piety whatſoever vertue ſeemeth to perke up, is but an <hi>Agar,</hi> an uſurper. Herewith a child of God (with any indifferencie of common gifts) proveth a non-pareil, matching and mating all the glorious paragons of men out of Chriſt. For, who ſhall ſtand in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with <hi>Abraham, David, Paul,</hi> or any of theſe, in whom grace hath had her perfect work? Nay, that which was ſpoken of the Lord contending with his enemies, is true (in a meaſure) of every child of his in this competition: for, <hi>wherein they deale proudly,</hi> even in that is <hi>he above them.</hi>

                     <p>Indeed there are times wherein iniquity like <hi>the harlot</hi>

He covers a fowle heart under a fair face; an ulcerous ſoul under neat cloaths, a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton heart under a modeſt habit, and a world of ſpiritual wickedneſſe under an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted gravity of carriage and behaviour: yet, as the abſurd Actor (when he thinks to do beſt) commits a ſoliciſme with his hand; ſo this hypocrite, with his face. He is a large and a curious buble, very ſmooth and ſhining without, but empty of all but winde within; or like ſome vain-glorious <hi>Italians</hi> that have their rooms of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment richly hung and furniſhed, but little ſtore of ſolid proviſion in the Kitchin or pantry, or of mony in the purſe to buy it.</p>

Where grace hath once entred the heart, there needs no exterior counterfeit covering. Inward holineſſe giveth outward comelineſſe; grace in the ſoul ſhines in the face, and makes the countenance lovely. As nature maketh the skin, and after nouriſheth and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from within; ſo grace maketh the beſt beauty without, and cheriſheth it ſo, that it never fades nor withers, but it recovers again and grows more amiable. This makes a man a new creature, whoſe outward skin is a part of the man, not as apparel that may be caſt off: or, if it be <hi>apparel,</hi> it firſt appareleth <hi>the inner man</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.3, 4.</note>; then, the outward. It firſt ſets him into Chriſt, and then helps him to put on Chriſt; firſt within, then without. Cloaths are ſhifted, and the faſhion altered; ſo are the outward ſemblances and behaviour of the hypocrite; he will be in the faſhion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt him; and off goes the old apparel, although but lately put on, when a newer faſhion is more in requeſt. But the true Chriſtian being firſt made like unto Chriſt, continueth ever after like himſelf. He will never caſt off thoſe garments which are all glorious within, nor his external garb that holds proportion with the inward clothing, let others change faſhion never ſo often. His very outward countenance and complexion as a Chriſtian, is the ſame with that grace which is within. How leprous ſoever he was before, yet grace is to him what the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were to <hi>Naaman, cauſing his fleſh</hi> (that is his outward part of the Chriſtian) <hi>to come again unto him as the</hi> ſmooth <hi>fleſh of a</hi> thriving <hi>childe</hi>

He knoweth that men learn much by ſignes and heroglyphicks; and that as in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <hi>Pronunciation;</hi> ſo in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> example may challenge, and win the firſt, ſecond and third place, as a ſpecial means to inſtruct and quicken the beholders to piety. Therefore he is careful even of his out-ſide alſo; but firſt he maketh <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide clean;</hi> as well knowing that otherwiſe the <hi>out-ſide</hi> will never be purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the purification of the Sanctuary to be accepted of God, and that it will never become him, or at leaſt not hold long with him.</p>
                     <p>The hypocrite may for a while out-ſhine him in the eyes of ſome men, who take all for gold that glitters; yet as artificial things differ from natural, and fictions of men from works of God, ſo doth the hypocrite from him that partakes of the divine nature, what ſhew ſoever he make outwardly to the world. And as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials,</hi> the neerer we come to them, and the further we look into them, the leſſe perfection is found in them; but <hi>natural,</hi> the more inward, the more admirable. The image that had ſo much coſt and curioſity beſtowed upon it, was at length neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it wanted ſomething <hi>within</hi> to make it act and move, in which reſpect a <hi>living dog is better then a dead lion.</hi> But when we look into any thing of Gods making, whether natural or ſupernatural, we cannot but break out with admiration, as <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made</hi>

                     <p>Thus the hypocrite is fair afar off, he muſt have diſtance to grace him: the Chriſtian is moſt lovely at hand; and the neerer you come to him, and the more exactly you ſearch him, the more beautiful he will appear. The one hath as it were a good colour, the other a good complexion. The one hath his face well painted, the other hath his blood well purged and defecated: The one is as a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The Spaniſh gravity and ſlow pace in them is not unſeemly, becauſe national; but in an Engliſh man, uncomely and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In a word, his geſtures ſhall be ſuch as ſhew devotion, not affectation; but whatever they be, they ſhall never go without the heart.

                        <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God.</hi> He is loath the ſhew of what he is not, ſhould bring into queſtion the truth of what he is and hath; he neglects not, but ſtudies all outward behaviour and comelineſſe that may bring honour to his profeſſion; but when he is moſt exact in his outward garb, it is not with a purpoſe to deceive, or of men to ſeek glory; but to approve himſelf to God and men by ſhewing forth outwardly ſome part of the treaſure that is in the heart; and that all his <hi>converſation</hi> may onely <hi>be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi>

                     <p>Underſtand this, where gravity is in faſhion, not where men profeſſe levity and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe as a choice piece of their education and profeſſion, (as in theſe times our young gallants count it their honour to glory in their ſhame, and to be aſhamed of nothing ſo much as of their true <hi>glory</hi>

There is a kind of light gravity held forth by ſome old Bachelours, who while they glory in their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and ſingle life, diſcover much wantonneſſe and lightneſſe, if not of their bodies, yet in their diſcourſe and behaviour. So there is always ſomething green and ſower in our hypocrites carriage able to ſet the teeth of a ſober man on edge, even when his <hi>almond</hi> gravity ſeems to flouriſh<note n="a" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.5.</note>; I mean, a ſet gravity, (like that of <hi>Socrates</hi> never ſeen to change countenance on any occaſion,) which muſt needs be affected, and much ſtraiten that lightneſſe and greenneſſe of luſts that is pent in, and will too often break out ere he be aware; for, whatſoever is forced, will not be perpetual. Things unnatural are troubleſome, and cannot long be endured. It is too much to be alwayes on the tenters. The ſinews of the minde no more than thoſe of the body, can abide a perpetual diſtention. Affectation of gravity is like a ſtreight ſhooe, that while it gives ſhape to the foot, wrings it, and therefore muſt either be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63232:41"/> ſhortly left off, or widened, that the ſhooe may come to the foot, not the foot to the ſhooe. Some put on a countenance for their better grace when they go abroad; which they put off when they return home for their greater eaſe; ſo, our hypocrite; yea, and at times too, while he is abroad upon the ſtage of diſſimulation, where it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to him as to the <hi>Apes</hi> that acted <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias;</hi> a few nuts thrown betwixt them, put them quite out of their parts; for the bait or object of this hypocrites ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſinne makes him forget his counterfeit acting, and to fall to that wickedneſſe which is to him as nuts to an Ape. The <hi>beard makes not a Philoſopher,</hi> nor <hi>the hood a Monk;</hi> yet this hypocrite hath nothing elſe of a grave man, but his countenance, geſture, apparel and gate, like thoſe, of whom it is ſaid,<note n="b" place="margin">Zech. 13.4.</note> 
                        <hi>they wore a rough gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deceive.</hi> His countenance promiſeth ſtayedneſſe and ſolidity, but his heart is as fleeting as the weathercock. He is like a childe in black, or an Ape in mourning. Popiſh Regulars excel in this Craft. Their order and rule ſpeak them grave; but their heart and life proclaime them wanton. Again, ſome ſeeme grave, but not out of true gravity, but becauſe ſtupid, ruthleſſe, and ſenſleſs, without affections or bowels; or, becauſe they are by nature ſlow, like the Aſſe that cannot mend his pace, or like a woodden horſe that cannot go out of the way; yea, ſometimes his gravity is as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous as that of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who alone came ſober to the Senate, to overthrow the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the Chriſtians habit is the true badge of a grave heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knows there is good uſe of gravity even in outward carriage, and that it is pity it ſhould be ſo much out of faſhion. <hi>By a ſad countenance the heart is made better</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.3.</note> It is as the north-winde to drive away flattery and ſycophancy. For a grave and juſt Governour <hi>chaſeth away all evil with his eyes</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 20, 8.</note>. Wherefore he maintaineth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a face and forme of gravity, not as an hypocrite, to deceive; but as <hi>Job</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Job 29.24.</note>, who even in ſmiling maintained an awful reſpect to hold up the reverence due to juſtice. Gravity and integrity meet in the Chriſtian that he may not deceive, but not in the hypocrite whoſe trade it is to delude. The Chriſtian makes gravity his ſtudy as well as his profeſſion; not to deſtroy affections; which were to dam up the fountaine, and to raſe the foundation of vertue, but to command and govern them. A man without affections is a woodden horſe that cannot go out of the way; but a Chriſtian having his affections gravely governed is the only man that goes right and is undefiled in the way. He is unmoveable from a good courſe, although not immovable in it! He may vary his Tropicks as neceſſity, or prudence may move him, but he never goes out of the eclyptick. If his paſſions do ſometimes draw him aſide, his prudence and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity are the legs that carry him into his way again. And ſo he makes a wild horſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, which a woodden one will never be.</p>
                     <p>Thus the hypocrite couſens by his gravity; the Chriſtian is grave that he may not abuſe himſelf to the damage of others. The one affects gravity for a ſhew; the other loves it for it ſelf. The one is grave when he ſeems moſt merry; the other ſhews light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his greateſt gravity.</p>

Counterfeit humility lifts up higher, and in the end caſts down lower then others ſins; for he that exalteth himſelf by ſeeming abaſement, ſhall be ſure in the end to be abaſed below the loweſt. Who ſo high, who ſo low, as <hi>Lucifer?</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:63232:41"/> There is alſo an impious humility, when men out of pretence of being no wiſer then their Fathers, no better then their neighbours, nor more religious then the Prince, take upon them to lift up themſelves againſt God and his truth.</p>
                     <p>Thus many perſecutors are mad againſt the truth, upon no other account, but that their Fathers never owned it, but have alwayes been of another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                        <hi>the Chriſtian endeavours to make his heart level with his eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His <hi>heart is not haughty, nor his eyes lofty</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 231.1</note>. If any difference be; he is more humble within then without, and his heart is more lowly of the too. He doth not <hi>caupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari-humilitatem,</hi> make Merchandiſe of his humility, much leſſe hunt after the glory of a ſhew of what he hath not in truth. He humbleth himſelf by <hi>eſteeming others better then himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note>, but not <hi>to draw</hi> them <hi>into his net</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 10.9.</note>. He gives all men their dues, <hi>honour to whom honour</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 13.7:</note>; but, in Chriſtian ingenuity, he preferreth God, Truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before all men.

But he had rather himſelf be a loſer in his credit then in his conſcience, or that God or his truth ſhould loſe by him; yea, that all men ſhould loſe rather than God ſhould be endamaged.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Hypocrite is as <hi>Haman</hi> doing honour to <hi>Mordecay</hi> with a proud heart; he leads his horſe when he would cut his throat<note n="m" place="margin">Eſter 6.11.</note>; the Chriſtian, as the diſciple of Chriſt, <hi>waſhing the feet</hi>

Some baſe humour of covetouſneſſe, ambition, uncleanneſſe or the like is his <hi>Genius,</hi> his familiar, cauſing his heart to drudge baſely after theſe Maſters, and making him a coward in the cauſe of God, which when it breaks out and appears, none ſo contemptible in the eſteem of others, as he that was moſt lofty in his own looks before others, that he might hide that baſeneſſe which indeed is in him.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>The true Chriſtian is higheſt in his reſolution,</hi>

So our hypocrite well knowes if he can but bring in a companion that will prove a rival, that in the end will thruſt truth beſides the Throne. Therefore if he have a minde to undermine any truth, let him ſet up any competitor, and his work is more then half done. He need but ſit ſtill and look on, he is ſure of the iſſue?

                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite hath recourſe to the Word for cloaths to apparel his baſtard; the true Chriſtian goes to the ſame word for milk to nouriſh the childe that was begotten of it; the one makes uſe of the word to name the childe of his own brain; the other writes the name of truth upon the childe of the Word.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is a great pretender to preſerve or reſtore the purity of Scripture, which he gives out to be corrupted; not that he careth for the Scripture more than <hi>Judas</hi> for the poore; but, that under colour of purging out this corruption, he may cut off what he liſt that makes againſt him. He can not only wreſt Scripture, but wring off the neck of it, if it ſtand in his way. He can mangle it by concealing a part, as Satan in alledging that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee,</hi> leaving out thoſe words (which indeed make the former capable of fulfilling) <hi>to keep thee in all thy wayes:</hi> that, ſhews where the protection and guard of Angels may be exſpected, not when we go without God, much leſſe when againſt him. Thus, the Papiſts, in their common Catechiſmes prepared for the vulgar, blot out the ſecond Commandment that might make their vaſſals to boggle at images, as if that were foiſted in by ſome Lutherans or Calviniſts, as the Northern borderers were wont to ſay of the eighth Commandment, when preſſed with it to ſuppreſſe their daily theeveries, that <hi>that Commandment was none of Gods making, but thruſt into the Decalogue by King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth.</hi> And, as ſome Arrians not able to ſtand before the ſtrength of that text,<note n="m" place="margin">1 John 5.7</note> 
                        <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> reject the whole as ſpurious, leſt their Dagon ſhould fall before it; ſo there are ſtill not wanting ſome who will make bold with Scripture to allow what makes for them, and to proſcribe what ever is againſt them; not upon that skore, but under colour of a ſpurious additament to the genuine Text.</p>
                     <p>Thus, they pretend the original of the Old Teſtament is corrupted by the Jews; and the original of the New by Hereticks, that thereby they may ſet up their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>vulgar Latine</hi>

                        <hi>the true diſciple of Chriſt eſteemeth every Word of God concerning all things to be right; nor daring to curtail, or alter it, or to adde unto it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doth not pick and chooſe, but he takes, and <hi>eats</hi> all <hi>the Book</hi> of God. He hath no deſign to croſſe the Word, therefore he hath no deſigne upon the Word to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or curtail it. He needs not to pervert, or decurt that holy and ſtreight Rule, or any Authour agreeing therewith, to maintain any private opinions. His Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is cut out by the meaſure of the Word. And if in any thing his opinions deviate from it, he will bring his opinions to the Word, or caſt them away. He knows that all truth is uniforme, no one part thwarteth another; and that, he takes for his cloathing; neither uſing the ſheers nor the needle; for he neither cuts off any part of the word as too much for his purpoſe, nor ſowes on any ſhreds to patch up his Religion. He can ſpare nothing which the Word affords, nor admit of any thing,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63232:47"/> although coming from <hi>an Angel from heaven,</hi> which may adde to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the hypocrite is like the falſe mother that is earneſt to have the child divided; the diſciple of truth, as the true mother, abhors that diviſion. The one cares not for Scripture, unleſſe he may order it as he pleaſeth; the other reverenceth it ſo much that he will not endure to ſee it mangled, but gives himſelfe up to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ordered by it.</p>

                     <p>Again, this hypocrite ſometimes, deſpairing of making out his fancies by plaine Texts, he flies to <hi>allegories,</hi> to prove the Popes tranſcendency above the Emperour, he quotes that place,<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 1.16.</note>

                     <p>Thus this hypocrite perverteth the Scripture by corrupting the letter, or turneth off our eyes from the ſenſe, by drawing them after pretended Allegories.

And ſo far is he from diſliking that ſenſe or Expoſition that is moſt common, that he loves it the better, becauſe ſo many of the judiciouſly learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concur in it; and is ſo much abhorrent from new coyned gloſſes, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſpects them till he hath ſifted them to the bran, which if he want ability to do, he will ſuſpend his entertaining of them, until by the help of ſome more able <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerner of things that differ,</hi> he hath <hi>tryed this Spirit</hi> whether it <hi>be of God or not</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63232:48"/> in vain to think of making a market of his indulgences, for they will never go off, without thoſe <hi>works</hi> as that which gives worth and value to them. Therefore he purſues with fire and fagot all that oppoſe them. All <hi>Germany</hi> muſt be in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, the Emperour muſt fight, and all muſt aſſiſt, if <hi>Luther,</hi> but a poor Monk, ſhall oppoſe theſe great truths of Antichriſt.

                     <p>Indeed all are not led with that low bait of baſe gaine, ſome with <hi>Corah and his company</hi> are taken with ambition to make themſelves higher, by making <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> lower.

                     <p>And thus, as it was with the old Phariſees, <hi>They loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God;</hi> ſo is it with all Hereticks, they have an eye at themſelves to their own gaine, wealth, applauſe, preferment, in all the ſtrugglings of their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zeale for their private opinions under the name and ſtile of the truths of God.</p>

In all profeſſions there muſt be <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>unanimity;</hi> unity to knit the members together; unanimity to keep them ſo.

                     <p>Nor doth he account it leſs madneſſe of the other ſide to think that we can never go far enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> in whatever they hold or practiſe, and to condemn all for Antichriſtian Idolatry and Popery that is to he found among them. For the devil is not ſuch a fool as to put his eldeſt ſon to make a total Apoſtacy, but he lets him hold ſome truths, and practiſe ſome duties allowed of God, the better to give countenance to the trumperies, witchcrafts, and deluſions which he hath received from the Devil. Baptiſme the Lords Supper, yea, the Goſpel it ſelf is not to be thrown off becauſe held and continued by Antichriſt. Nay rather, God permits him to maintain and preſerve theſe, that thoſe men who embrace true piety, may take them up and uſe them with more purity, and to better purpoſes. He will not go further from the devil himſelf, then he goes from God. He will not reject truth as errour, becauſe that father of lies confeſſeth it. Wil any wiſe man deny Chriſt <hi>to be the holy one of God,</hi> becauſe the<note n="n" place="margin">Mar. 1.24.</note> devil once pronounced him to be ſo? Will any diſcreet Chriſtian throw off all truths that the devil hath taken up? Will any hate the light, becauſe <hi>Satan transformeth himſelf into an Angel of light</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor 11.14</note>?</p>
                     <p>The wiſe Chriſtian therefore ſeparateth from Satan as Satan, from Papiſts as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; from wicked men wherein they are wicked; from every one ſo far and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he ſeparateth himſelf from God, as fearing the footſteps of ſuch ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that they who affect and begin it, ceaſe not till they have ſeparated themſelves, not only from all Religion, but common honeſty.</p>
                     <p>Thus this hypocrite incloſeth other mens commons and ſo deſtroys his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in the communion of Saints; the other throws open all incloſures which may prejudice the leaſt and weakeſt of Saints in the enjoying of his juſt rights.

                     <p>He hath gotten ſo much eye-ſight as to finde fault, but not ſo much judgement as to diſcover the true way to redreſs it.

To joyn in evil, as in ſuperſtition, &amp;c. is a great ſinne; but therefore to ſeparate from the ſuperſtitious in commanded duties is an evil which he ſeeth not.

It is good to ſtick cloſe to the written word, even in worſhip and diſcipline, as well as in doctrine; but not to force the holy Ghoſt, ſeeking by ſtrained interpretations to make him father of all our conceits. If men have a minde to be contentious (as all Schiſmaticks have) there will be no end of ſtrife, eſpecialy in things wherein the Scriptures ſpeak not expreſſely and definitively. For in things of this nature, better have to do with an Heretick, then with a Schiſmatick; for although in the Schiſmatick the matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be of leſſe weight, yet the ſpirit of contention is greater, and the violence more ſtrong to maintaine it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is the fountain of Schiſme, the arrogating of that to a mans ſelf which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him, with contempt of others whom they ought to honour.

He thinks ſo well of himſelf, that he believes himſelf able to govern his Governours, and to rule his Rulers; and to be, if not a Magiſtrate, yet a reformer even of Magiſtracy it ſelf, and of all that execute it. He is like an ill man'd colt that takes the bit in his teeth, and runs away with his Rider, and never leaves running (unleſs ſtopped by force) till he hath caſt him.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Miniſters office, this <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices will make more bold,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63232:55"/> not only to reprehend, but uſurp it. For doting on his own conceited guifts, he makes no bones to become a <hi>Teacher cf the Law, underſtanding neither what he ſayth, nor whereof he affirmeth</hi>

                     <p>He uſeth Religion, as men loving contention make uſe of the Law, that is, to make it a cudgel to break other mens heads (although many times with the ruine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) not as a means to reduce and reclaime them. His zeal is more againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then corruptions; and if againſt corruptions, it is for the perſons; ſake and he is againſt the perſons for their places ſake; not ſimply, but becauſe he may not have them, who in his own opinion is more worthy of them. Firſt, he falls out, and then hunts to finde out ſome fault to warrant his quarrelling; and (as the Donatiſts of old) is more glad to find a fault then to ſee it amended, and to proclaim then to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, to carp then to cure it, and is unwilling the colour of evil ſpeaking ſhould be taken away.</p>
                     <p>There is no duty which he practiſeth ſo much as reprehenſion, none that he more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth in the practiſe of it. In reprehending, he ſets by the <hi>ſpirit of meekneſſe,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all reverence: He knows not how to <hi>entreat an Elder as a Father,</hi> but rather as <hi>Shemei</hi> reviled <hi>David</hi> to his face, as his ſlave. He cannot ſpeak of authority, but with ſlighting; or of Miniſtry, but with contempt.</p>
                     <p>And as himſelf is, ſo he ſeeks to make his aſſociates and diſciples, whom by perverſe ſpeakings he can <hi>draw after him.</hi> He makes his choice among the meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are ſooneſt deluded, and moſt violent after engagement; for they being leaſt able to judge, are ſooneſt flatter'd into a high conceit of their own ſufficiency, and ſo are the fitteſt timber whereof he ſeeks to erect his frame, as being moſt apt to envy others above them, and moſt heady and furious in faction againſt thoſe whom they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; contrary to the Papiſt, who delights to deal moſt with the rich and noble, who are ableſt to pay the beſt price for their ſalvation, and to help him to bear rule by their means.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the ſober Chriſtian meaſureth his duty by his place.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As he forſakes not his calling, ſo he exceeds not his bounds in that calling. He can heartily reverence the Magiſtrate for his place, even when he mourns for his failings and corruptions He giveth place to authority, as a <hi>power ordained of God</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 13.2</note>; though not to build faith upon; yet to keep order, and to be <hi>the Miniſter of God for his good.</hi> He knows that God is a God of order, and hath appointed to each member his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>office,</hi> as well as <hi>place</hi> in the body; and that the leaſt diſlocation of any member, is both troubleſome and dangerous to the whole body. His main care therefore in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the community, is, that there may <hi>be no Schiſme in the body</hi>

But the ſuperſtitious perſon is far more dangerous in the conſequent and iſſue, becauſe he maketh God to be what he is not, and the creature to be what it is not, putting upon God his own ſuperſtitious fancies as true worſhip: and gives rules to others to do the like.

                     <p>He knowes that however falſe gods be good fellowes, and care not how many we worſhip, ſo themſelves be not left out, and be content with any worſhip (as the Devill from Chriſt<note n="x" place="margin">Matth. 4.9.</note>), ſo they may have ſome; yet the true God is more jealous, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits neither of fellowes, nor ſo much as of worſhip that is not of his own preſcribing for <hi>manner</hi>

                     <p>Superſtition is a large field containing whatſoever is taken from God, and given to the Creature under pretence of ſerving God more exactly. He will <hi>worſhip Angels</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 2.18.</note> that thereby he may ſeem more devoutly to worſhip God. He will <hi>in a voluntary humility,</hi> worſhip <hi>Saints,</hi> under colour of being more humble in his addreſſes to God by them. Ignorant he is of the true God, and his ignorance makes him abound in ſuperſtition, even untill he riſe up at laſt to groſſe Idolatry, if not ſtopt in his courſe by inſtruction touching the nature of the true God, and the true worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p>He ſeemes in his profeſſion to abhorre <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet naturally fals into it ere he be aware, even when he thinks himſelf furtheſt off from it. For he that pretendeth to worſhip God otherwiſe then himſelf hath preſcribed, worſhippeth not God, but gives a will worſhip to ſome other thing that is not God, but a god of his own making, whether through a falſe notion of the mind, as ſometimes Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conceived of the God head, as of <hi>a Globe of fire;</hi>

                     <p>To ſpeak here of the innumerable ſuperſtitions found among heathens without the pales of the viſible Church, upon which they engraffed all their Idolatries, Divinations, Incantations, Adjurations, Sorceries, and other abominable practiſes, is out of our line at this time; we being now upon the ſent of an hypocrite within the Church, whoſe religion is little other then meer ſuperſtition: Nor ſhall I purſue all the ſuperſtitious fopperies of that Schiſmatical Synagogue of Satan, the pretended Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for we are now hunting of thoſe cloſer hypocrites among our ſelves that profeſſe departure from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and make great ſhews of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet is nothing elſe but a mask for their more cloſe and ſubtile ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>He is a great <hi>Devoto;</hi> but, wherein? If the creature command any thing in worſhip; as, cringing, or ducking to an <hi>Altar,</hi> obſerving of <hi>meates,</hi> or <hi>dayes,</hi> or <hi>formes:</hi> No man ſhall go beyond him, or reach him. A <hi>Saints</hi> day is more religiouſly obſerved than the Lords <hi>Sabbath;</hi> a Surplice more carefully put on, than the New man: the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi> more devoutly attended, than the moſt ſoul-piercing Sermon. He can better away with a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> than with a diſcourſe againſt that ſuperſtition. He is more affraid of an Hare croſſing his way, than of an Harlot in his bed: more troubled at a ſalt falling towards him, than of the guilt of ſinne lying heavy upon him. He ſetteth up ſome Saint in Heaven as an over potent favourite in groſſing both the graces of the Prince, and the priviledges of the Subject. With him the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> is above her Sonne, if not to command him, yet to do feates in heaven, more than faith in the heart, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with him. Images and pictures are unto him better inſtructers then the written word, and greater helps to his devotion then the Goſpel of Chriſt. An Image, an <hi>Ephod,</hi> and a <hi>Teraphim</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Hoſ. 3.4.</note> are all one to him that reſpects not truth ſo much as blind devotion. If be have them, he is never the better; but, if he want them, farewell his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>With him the <hi>Starres,</hi> who were ſet for ſignes and ſeaſons of things natural, are made more ſurely prophetical and predictionary, than the Prophets of God that decry thoſe fooleries: he can gather more things future, contingent, and voluntary, from the Starres, than from the Scriptures, touching the ſad providences that may befall him or others for ſinne. He aſcribes more to <hi>Hali</hi> than to <hi>Paul:</hi> he can tell you more what weather is likely to be, from the obſervation of Saint <hi>Swithines</hi> day, the <hi>twelve dayes</hi> of <hi>Chriſt-tide,</hi> the <hi>Converſion of Paul,</hi> or of the Thurſday before the change of the Moone, than he is able to diſcerne of <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> even when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is preached unto him<note n="f" place="margin">Luke 12.56.</note>. And thus, as common people uſe to be more favourable in their opinions to Empericks and Wizzards, than to the ſolid Phyſician (obſerving when they hit, and diſſembling, when they miſſe;) ſo this hypocrite will plead more

And ſo vaine is he, that theſe <hi>ſhadows</hi> affect him more then the <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> he lays out more of his heart, purſe, and labour upon them, than upon the body it ſelfe; whereby it comes to paſſe that, embracing (as he did, a <hi>cloud</hi> inſtead of <hi>Juno</hi>) the ſhadow of Chriſt our King, he lets the Prince himſelfe go unſaluted; and, catching at the ſhadow of meat, <hi>dreaming that he eats,</hi> when he comes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake he will finde himſelf <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>hungry,</hi> and muſt needs ſtarve for want of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid food.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the faithful Chriſtian embraceth the ſubſtance as ſucceeding to the ſhadow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knows that many things which had a good beginning and uſe, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perpetual; but, many times, of a temporary nature and office. What better then the <hi>brazen Serpent?</hi> yet, what worſe when abuſed to ſuperſtition? At firſt, it led to Chriſt; afterwards, from him to the devil: Therefore then, he will <hi>break it in pieces</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">2 King. 18.4</note>. He looks upon Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, as ſhining out of the Eaſt, that made large and long ſhadows to thoſe Fathers that then lived; but now he beholds him as in his <hi>Meridian,</hi> or rather <hi>Zenith,</hi> where he neither makes, nor admits of any ſhadow at all. The <hi>body</hi> at a diſtance is the cauſe of the <hi>ſhadow;</hi> not the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the body is preſent, and <hi>neer us, even in the mouth and in the heart</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note>, he looks no longer after the ſhadow, but fixeth only upon the body, and keeps cloſe to that. He that was the cauſe of them, hath taken them away, and is come himſelf in their room.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſhadow</hi> is not the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but a mere accident that can never do the deed exſpected from the <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> but the body is the ſubſtance that muſt effect it. He wiſely conſidereth that thoſe <hi>ſhadowes</hi> of rites and <hi>ſacrifices could never make the commers thereunto perfect;</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 10.1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>for then they would not have ceaſed to be offered:</hi> He finds no true righteouſneſſe, expia ion of ſin, or peace of conſcience in them; but in Chriſt, the Body, he hath all. And when he looks upon the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> he finds it to be a very obſcure and imperfect figure of the <hi>Body;</hi> eſpecially in former times, before the body, appeared. It is hard to know a man by his ſhadow till himſelf appeare, So Chriſt was hardly and rarely known by thoſe ſhadowes before his coming in the fleſh. And when he comes, he cauſeth the <hi>ſhadow to flee away,</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Cant. 2 17.</note> yea, not to be. With good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore doth the faithfull Chriſtian content himſelf with the <hi>Body,</hi> looking no more after the <hi>ſhadow.</hi>

                     <p>He can like well of continency and chaſtity, but if God call him to marriage, he looks upon it as both lawful and honourable<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 13.4</note>. He accounts it no leſſe violence to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tentation to ſin, without the ſpecial gift of continency, not given to all, to vow perpetual virginity; becauſe, neither is <hi>virginity</hi> in it ſelf <hi>ſimply good;</hi> for then the commoner the better: which is not ſo in this caſe, becauſe then, both man-kinde and the Church muſt periſh: nor is it (as every vertue is) an habit of the minde, but a privation, and belongeth to the body; nor is the contrary of <hi>virginity</hi> evil, as the contrary to <hi>chaſtity</hi> is. Therefore he interprets our Saviours ſaying<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 19.11.</note>, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it,</hi> not as meant of all, nor to any ſort of men, (for <hi>all men cannot receive it;</hi>) but to them only <hi>to whom it is given</hi>

                     <p>It is the nature of ſuperſtition to binde where God looſeth, and to looſe where God bindeth, to fiſh in troubled waters, and to delight in puzzling and perplexing both himſelf and others: for being purblinde, the ſuperſtitious hypocrite is alwayes poaching and poring in the dark, and naturally ſtumbles upon that which proves a ſtumbling block both to himſelf and others, <hi>cauſing diviſions and offences.</hi> He is <hi>dogmatized,</hi> that is, <hi>ſubject to,</hi> and burdened <hi>with Ordinances,</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Col. 2.20.</note> that perplex and trouble him, and he is well contented with it. For, <hi>he ſuffers, if a man bring him into bondage, if a man devoure him, if a man take of him, if a man exalt himſelf, if a man ſmite him on the the face</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.20</note>.</p>
                     <p>He wil ſtand ſtil with the pack-horſe, or rather kneel down with the Camel, to take his load, till his back crack again. Moſt of his inquiries, moſt of his zeal runnes out upon doubtful ſubjects, <hi>doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings, perverſe disputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 6 4, 5.</note>. His chief Quaeres are, whether ſuch and ſuch meats be lawful? whether ſuch dayes be to be obſerved? and, being ſtupified with ſuperſtition, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with ſome helliſh apprehenſions, he eaſily ſubjects his conſcience to every mans tyranny, that wil lay <hi>a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall, in his way</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 14.13.</note>. He can ſwallow a Purgatory, a whip in <hi>Lent,</hi> with greateſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And as he is a troubler of his own houſe and ſoul, ſo is he a great diſturber of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially if he be, or conceit himſelf to be of any learning and parts. He is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his <hi>doubtful diſputations,</hi> even when he is to deal with the <hi>weakeſt</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 1.</note>, whereas he <hi>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not pleaſe himſelf,</hi> but to <hi>pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 15.1, 2</note>. <hi>He zealouſly affecteth</hi> the people he hath to do with, <hi>but not well; yea, he would exclude them, that they might affect him</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 4.17.</note>. He can preſſe upon them a Purgatory, Images, a Crucifix, and what not; and ſo troubles them, that he deſerves to be <hi>cut off</hi>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 15.10</note>, yet this he endeavours with might and maine <hi>to put upon the necks of the diſciples:</hi> and, it is ſtrange to ſee that men ſhould be ſo mad and greedy when God hath pull'd down the wall of that <hi>Bride-wel,</hi> to run again into that priſon, and to fetter themſelves, and other anew.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrarily, the <hi>true Chriſtian is ever delighted moſt in thoſe truths which ſet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience free.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He will <hi>not be the ſervant of men</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note>, that load and entangle him with niceties and ſcruples; but, as the free ſervant of Chriſt, he will keep himſelf free from all men that attempt it. He looks upon himſelf as redeemed<note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18</note> from whatever he <hi>received by tradition from his fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He diſdains all comforters that pretend to give eaſe to his conſcience by penances, pilgrimages, whippings, confeſſions in the ears of a Prieſt, and ſuch like miſerable comforts. He looks upward above all theſe to the blood of Chriſt, to ſatisfie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, to expiate ſin, and to pacifie conſcience. <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave him, he will not ride upon horſes of his own ſtrength or merit; neither will he ſay to the works of his hands, ye are my gods.</hi> But, in God alone he expects to <hi>finde mercy</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Hoſ 14.3.</note>. His cordials drawn hence, the more they are examined, the more they are approved, and do give more full and laſting, yea everlaſting conſolations and good hope through grace;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63232:62"/> for mercy is infinite whereby God was moved to promiſe grace; his truth infallible whereby he is engaged to keep promiſe, and his power omnipotent to make good his engagement; which he apprehends, not as the deſpairing conſcience apprehends God to be ſtrong to condemn or deſtroy; but, mighty to ſave. And into theſe, the more narrowly we look, the more bottomleſſe we find them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite hath the art of diſturbance; the true Chriſtian labours to ſettle all upon a firm foundation. The one cares not how he loads the conſcience with unneceſſary burdens, the other ſeeks to eaſe it of uncomfortable fears; the one <hi>troubles his own houſe, and inherits the winde</hi>

                     <p>Of ſome things he is willingly ignorant, that he may not abate of his blind devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he loves not to hear what may open his eyes to ſee the vanity and folly of what he affecteth, but rather gives a ſtop to ſuch diſcourſes. He <hi>cloſeth his eyes that he might not ſee</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 13.15</note>, <hi>and ſtoppeth his eares that he might not hear,</hi> and loves to be <hi>groping in the dark as if he had no eyes</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Eſay 54.10.</note>. If comfort or counſel be offered him even in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, contrary to his own way and blinde profeſſion, he cries out as once that Popiſh Biſhop lying on his death-bed did, when one of his fellow Biſhops viſiting him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to relie upon the merits of Chriſt alone for ſalvation: <hi>O my Lord,</hi> quoth he, <hi>no more of that; if you once open that gap to the people, then farewell all.</hi> Thus as the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſometimes puniſhed thoſe who made known the cauſes of <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> becauſe it diminiſhed fear and ſuperſtition in the people; ſo this hypocrite ſhuns nothing more then too much knowledge in himſelf or others, whereby the eſteem of his ſuperſtitious vanities, and his own judgement about them ſhould be abaſed. As ignorance in natural Philoſophy raiſeth a belief and reputation of counterfeit miracles; ſo ignorance in the ſuperſtitious is not only the mother but ſupporter of all ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous devotion. Therefore he will not hear of confutations of merits of works of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Purgatory, ſuperſtitious cuſtomes, &amp;c. but avoids all diſputations about them all he can, and had rather be blinde with ſuperſtition, than have his underſtanding opened to deliver him from it.</p>
                     <p>When he ſpeaks, he loves to ſpeak darkly and ambiguouſly; leaſt, ſpeaking out plainly, all would decry him. Therefore as painted faces ſeek a ſhade, ſo doth ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition endeavour to deliver it ſelf in the dark. He is good at <hi>darkning counſel, by words without knowledge</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Job 38.2.</note>. Hence as the Heatheniſh Prieſts had their <hi>mythologies,</hi> and ſtrange canting expreſſions of their imaginary unacceſſable deities, to amaze and low-bel their blinde ſuperſtitious followers, and thereby to hold up their Popiſh and apiſh idolatries in greater veneration; ſo this hypocrite hath his termes of Art ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his ſuperſtition wherein he nuzzleth his blinde diſciples.

                     <p>His very Temples and places of devotion muſt be as dark as ſumptuous; as ſecluſe as pompous. The windows muſt be darkned with pictures in them, that ſo the very places may ſtrike a kinde of terrour into all that frequent thoſe places. He knows that counterfeit beauties are more glorious by torch-light, or in the ſhade than in open Sun; ſo are all his fopperies and counterfeit devotions more lovely, or rather leſſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in a darkiſh room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His works alſo are in the dark</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Eſay 29.15</note>, therefore he hateth the light. And as of old, the <hi>ancients</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had their groſſeſt idolatries<note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Ezek. 8.12</note>; ſo this hypocrite hath his more odious ſuperſtitions in corners and in the dark, where he may more fully ſtretch and glut himſelf upon them, with leſſe contradiction or notice. He hath his private <hi>Oratories,</hi> and in them his Altar, Tapers, and all other Maſſing trinkets more compleat than in the Cathedral. And there he powers out his ſuperſtitious devotions, with greater zeal,

                     <p>He can tell you punctually how many degrees and orders there are among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, their names, natures, offices and degrees, as if he had been a traveller in heaven as many years, as <hi>Lucian</hi> in the orb of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and can relate as many ſtories of them, as ever <hi>Lucian</hi> did of the inhabitants of that <hi>Lunary</hi> world; only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that whereas <hi>Lucian,</hi> although an enemy to Religion, and to God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it, was yet ſo ingenuous as to acknowledge, that in his book <hi>de vera hiſtoria,</hi> his Readers ſhould take nothing for true in it, but only this one confeſſion, that <hi>in it there was nothing true;</hi> this hypocrite will have all his <hi>lies</hi> to be taken for <hi>truths;</hi> and thoſe, no leſſe than <hi>divine.</hi>

                     <p>This is his utmoſt <hi>Tether,</hi> to which he confines all his knowledge, all his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries both for himſelf, and all that enquire of him<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 29.29</note>. Not that he refuſeth to improve reaſon the light of the ſoul, and candle of the Lord, to ſee what cannot be diſcerned by ſenſe ſo far as reaſon can diſcover it; and ſo, ſecond faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. There are ſome things inviſible to ſenſe, which reaſon can deſcry; and ſome things may be diſcovered to reaſon, which only faith can believe: Not that faith makes reaſon the ground of belief, but only ſatisfies the beleever, that what he believeth, is not unreaſonable. So that the Chriſtian, not only by the eye of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> can ſee both earthly and heavenly bodies; and by the eye of reaſon, he underſtands things univerſal and immaterial, meditates on things abſent, attains to concluſions of Art, and to the order of cauſes and effects yea, to ſome diſcovery <hi>of the inviſible things of God,</hi> (not to know all that God doth or intendeth; but, to finde out <hi>an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power and God-head</hi>) from <hi>the things that are made</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.20</note>: But (which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercy of all) by the eye of <hi>faith</hi> (which begins and goes on, where reaſon is at a ſtand, and can go no further; yea, leads reaſon beyond it ſelfe) <hi>he ſeeth him that is inviſible</hi>

                     <p>What the Scripture ſaith of God, Heaven, Hell, or ought elſe revealed by God in his Word, he reverently receiveth, diligently enquireth into, and firmly beleeveth.

                     <p>He never troubles himſelf about the houre or day of the laſt judgement: only he conſidereth that it muſt be, and therefore (by all <hi>holy converſation and godlineſſe) looketh for, and haſteneth to the coming of the day of God</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 Pet 3.11, 12</note>. He beleeves the benefit appointed of God by the Miniſtry of Angels; and therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth them as his guard ſet about him by God, but doth not worſhip them as God, becauſe his <hi>fellow ſervants;</hi> he makes uſe of their Miniſtry, without enquiring after their names, orders, or degrees which Scripture hath not diſcovered.

                     <p>Of the ſame ſpirit and ſtamp is the <hi>Allegorizer</hi> who hath opened the flood-gate of errour by turning the Scripture into a Poetical fiction. <hi>Origen</hi> was in this kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heady, but the ſuperſtitious Romaniſt and Familiſt have far exceeded him; the one making this wilde mythology one of their foure <hi>Senſes;</hi> and the other, the only ſenſe of Scripture. The ſource of all theſe and the like dotages in the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Hypocrite proceeds from the admiration of his own fooliſh reaſon, whereby he hath maintained a private conference with his own brain-ſick heart, the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer and impoſtor in the world.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the faithful Chriſtian asks for the old paths, the good way,</hi>

                     <p>He makes uſe of <hi>ſenſe</hi> as an intelligencer to <hi>reaſon;</hi> and of <hi>reaſon</hi> as a counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of State unto <hi>faith:</hi> but faith is judge of all, and makes her own choice; is not ſwayed by others that ſerve her, but incouraged to go on in her own way the better; making uſe of their counſel, but ſeeing more then her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors.</p>
                     <p>He can admit of new methods and models that may make truth more cleare, and facile to the underſtandings of thoſe he hath to deal with all, but ſhuns all ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dangerous expreſſions, as inlets to errour, and enemies to the truth, although they may with an interpretation be defended. He conſidereth that he that delights to walk in amphibologies and doubtful expreſſions, either is or would be a deceiver, that as yet dares not ſpeak plainly, till he ſee how his opinions will take, therefore he reſolves both in opinion, language and practiſe to <hi>walk uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel.</hi> He will not bribe Reaſon to corrupt Faith, but bring her into ſubjection unto faith. He will hear reaſon, but not be judged by her in matters of faith. <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhall be his torch; but, the <hi>Word,</hi> his ſcene, and to this <hi>light,</hi> he brings every opinion in queſtion.</p>

                     <p>He may ask <hi>Queſtions;</hi> but he doth it, not for trial, but ſatisfaction; not to vent or open a way to a new opinion, but to be ſetled in the old truth, and to be made ſound in the faith: not to quarrel, but to edifie; not out of curioſity, but love to the truth, as the Diſciples oft-times asked Queſtions of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Yea more; when he findes men highly conceited of their own abilities, and yet ſtrongly ſeducing men from the truth to errour, or ſeeking to intrap him by capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous propoſals, He holds it not amiſſe by asking queſtions which he knows they cannot, or dare not anſwer, to lay open their folly before all men, whom they ſeek to deceive. Thus Chriſt often propounded Queſtions to the Phariſees, when he ſaw their errours<note n="x" place="margin">Luke 2.46.</note>, or ſmelt out their <hi>temptings</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 22.20. Mar. 11.29.</note>, or thought fit to lay open their ignorance who gave themſelves out to be the profoundeſt and moſt occular <hi>Rabbi's</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 22.42</note>. So alſo when he would inſtruct the ignorant, he findes the asking of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be one of the beſt inlets to the truths he would informe them in, becauſe the very propounding of a Quaere touching what they know not, puts their mind and thoughts on work to conſider more of the thing propounded, and ſo renders them more docile and willing to receive inſtruction<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16, 13, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of Scripture, he dares no more impoſe a new <hi>ſenſe,</hi> than a new Goſpel. He admits of thoſe allegories which he findes in Scripture, but makes none of his own; when the words are figurative, he conſiders the context and ſcope, and from thence collecteth the ſenſe and mind of the holy Ghoſt. He will be as wiſe as he can; but, <hi>according to ſobriety,</hi> and open Scripture as clearly as he can; but <hi>according to analogy,</hi> or <hi>proportion if faith,</hi> that he may not make truths to enterfeir, nor put a ſenſe upon an obſcure text which may croſſe another more plaine.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Hypocrite is no body, if you admit not his novelty; the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is an enemy to novelty, and to all that introduce it. The one mindes nothing but his own things; the other onely the <hi>things of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the one makes plain things obſcure, the other makes obſcure things plaine.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Humility</hi> is preſcribed of God, and Chriſt gives the pattern to which he requires conformity<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 11.29</note>; but this hypocrite will needs go beyond it, or elſe he thinks he doth nothing. He is for a <hi>voluntary humility</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 2.18</note>, even beyond precept or exemple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, an humility ſtretched out by hypocriſie beyond what in duty is required, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility choſen and taken up by his own will, thereby the more to inſinuate himſelf and his own opinions into the minds and hearts of thoſe whom he ſeeks to corrupt and deceive.</p>
                     <p>It pleaſeth men well to ſee others carry themſelves low and beneath him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this grace is carefully counterfeited, and this net cunningly ſpred by the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. This argument he uſeth for <hi>prayer to Saints,</hi> dare any man be ſo bold as to go directly and immediately to Chriſt? nay, be more humble, and take ſome Saint in your way: for Purgatory, think you ſo well of your ſelf, as when you die to ſtep immediately into heaven? nay, take Purgatory in your way; For <hi>beleeving in the Church,</hi> will you take upon you to be wiſer then the whole Church, or then Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or Chriſts Vicar-general upon earth? will you queſtion the deciſions of <hi>Councels,</hi> received by your Anceſtors? nay, beleeve as the Church believes, and as your father and grand-father have believed: <hi>for blinde obedience,</hi> will you refuſe to follow the rules of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> Saint <hi>Francis, &amp;c?</hi> Were not this intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable pride? nay, ſubmit abſolutely to your Superiors. Thus the maſters of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition bear themſelves out among their novices and vaſſals, againſt all arguments brought to refuſe their follies, upon their great (but fained) humility, becauſe thoſe <hi>things have indeed a ſhew of humility</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Col. 2.23</note>; and ſeem to commend the ſame humility to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the more eaſily thereby to ſeduce them.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch humility is but a cloak for pride by them objected to others who will not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63232:65"/> ſubmit to their traditions and trumpery. For it magnifieth man above God, by making man wiſer than God, and mans will a more abſolute rule and Law of faith and obedience then the will and Law of God, for that when God appoints none of theſe things, this hypocrite takes upon him <hi>to ſhew you a more excellent way.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men are of one nature, end every vain man would be wiſe; he that magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth others, magnifies himſelf. All wicked men are proud, even towards men, and too apt to lift up the horn even againſt God himſelf; but none are cunningly proud, but the ſeemingly humble hypocrite that knows how to put on humility for a cloak, in which he is his crafts-maſter: he is more proud of his masked hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, than others of their bravery, and can do the more miſchief, as that dog which fights loweſt, will ſooneſt take hold of the bull, and hold him faſt when he hath him.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian is humble according unto Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>This is Gods allowance, and nature craves it, therefore he dares not defraud his body of it. The <hi>fleſh</hi> as oppoſed to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> taken either for grace or the worker of it, is a wicked quality, and this he endeavours to <hi>crucifie</hi>

                     <p>He never accounts that to be true grace, that is an enemy to Gods creature; nor that to be worſhip of God, which deſtroys the worſhipper. He looks upon the body as the lodging and inſtrument of the ſoul, which God is ſo careful of, that whoever deſtroys it, ſhall himſelf be deſtroyed<note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 9.6</note>. And for as much as Chriſt himſelf aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a body as well as a ſoul, redeemed the body<note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20</note> by the price of his own blood, and hath honoured it ſo far as to make it the <hi>Temple of the holy Ghoſt</hi>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note>. Knowledge preſumed is a ſure ſymptome of ignorance which is incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; but ignorance confeſſed is a clear evidence of ſome ſaving knowledge, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to more.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite pretends unto knowledge, yet is ignorant; the true Chriſtian confeſſeth his ignorance, even when he hath in part attained to true ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: the one boaſteth of what he hath not, the other bewailes what he hath too much of: the one by giving himſelfe out to be a ſcioliſt, continues a ſot; the other by acknowledging his ignorance, continually grows in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 131.1</note>, becauſe <hi>he thinks not of himſelfe more highly then he ought to think, but thinks ſoberly</hi>

                     <p>Thus, though in <hi>Davids</hi> opinion, <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> her ſelf ſaith to this man, <hi>That there is no fear of God before his eyes; yet he flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, untill his iniquity be found,</hi> even by men as well as by God, <hi>to be hateful</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 36.1, 2.</note>; ſo that there is no difference between him and a pure Atheiſt, ſave onely in an external ſhew of an halfing, halting profeſſion of God, with a ſecret hatred of the life of godlineſſe. For every hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is in heart an Atheiſt, and would be ſo in profeſſion too, if he durſt: but therefore is he an hypocrite, becauſe he dares not openly profeſſe, what ſecretly he is.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the true Chriſtian had rather endure any thing than call in Religion to bear him out in the leaſt ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had rather periſh, than God ſhould deny, or be unlike himſelf. <hi>Let God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be true and every man a liar</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 3.4</note>. He had rather any diſcredit ſhould light upon himſelf and his action, than that Religion ſhould ſuffer in the leaſt by being put to tell a lie for him, as if it were not a ſin, or he were not guilty, when he hath
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63232:72"/> done any wickedneſſe; and that Religion would be his warrant, and bear him out in it. He knows that <hi>God is of purer eyes then to behold evil, that he cannot look on ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Hab. 1.13.</note>, without abhorrency, and deteſtation; and, that <hi>he hateth all workers of iniquity</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 5.5.</note>. Therefore he dares not call in God to patronize his covetouſneſſe, worldlineſs, or any other ſinful practiſe, although in him but an infirmity; but lays himſelf low before God, as having highly diſhonoured him by the leaſt deviation from the holy Commandment.</p>
                     <p>He that dares not <hi>tell a lie for God,</hi> much leſſe dares to put God upon telling a lie for him, as the profane hypocrite doth, when he fathers upon God, and the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſpirit the evil he doth, and wreſteth the Scripture to countenance whatever ſin he commits; eſpecially when he is to deal with men that profeſſe honour to God, and obedience to his Word.</p>
                     <p>When he is purged, he yet thinks not himſelf clean enough. When he is pure in moſt mens eyes, he is not ſo in his own, becauſe he comes not up fully to <hi>the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the true Sanctuary.</hi> Yea, when he is pure in Gods eyes<note n="i" place="margin">Cant. 4.10.</note>, becauſe waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the blood of Chriſt perfectly, unto <hi>Juſtification;</hi> and, with the Spirit of Chriſt <hi>truely,</hi> unto Sanctification; (and happily too pure, in the eyes of ſome men, for which they ſpeak <hi>evil of him</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.4.</note>, Yet ſtill he cries out, <hi>waſh me, much-waſh me</hi> (that is, <hi>more throughly) from mine iniquity, and cleanſe me from my ſin</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 51.2.</note>; and, <hi>create in me a clean heart, O God</hi>

Thus, he is ſtill complaining of himſelf, and juſtifying God; he holds up Gods honour and the credit of Religion, whatever become of himſelf. And when he hath moſt need of a cloak to cover his nakedneſſe, he will never call God to caſt Religion upon him to hide his ſhame; nor ſeek patronage from that which he knows condemneth his practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite profaneth Religion to ſave his own credit; the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſets more by the honour of Religion, than by his own life; the one ſtrives to make God and Religion like himſelf; the other upholds the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion by acknowledging his wandrings, and ſtriving to be like unto God.</p>

Becauſe Chriſt hath ſet us free from the curſe and bondage of the Law, he concludes for Libertiniſme; and, that every one may live as he liſt: the Familiſt concludes he can now no more ſinne then Chriſt himſelf; the Anabaptiſts, that Chriſtians are no longer to be under a compulſory civil Government; the Antinomian, that he is no longer under the Law, as a rule of life to him that is in Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>But, no wonder to ſee this hypocrite to begrudge God his time, who grudgeth him his heart; and, that he delights not in God, who bethinks the time and means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with him. For the property of the <hi>prophane</hi> hypocrite is, to be, if not ſo farre from God as he would be, yet to be as little while in his company, and to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as may be: Counterfeit piety affects paucity of precepts, and looſe hearts make void as many rules as they can, and the reſt as wide as their profane brains are able to ſtretch them.</p>

                     <p>Hath the Lord diſcharged him every ſeventh day from the cares and toils of this life, to ſerve him onely? he <hi>will make the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord honourable</hi>

                     <p>Thus this hypocrite uſeth Religion as a file to get off his fetters; the true Chriſtian, as a bond, to tye him cloſer unto God; the one pleads conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſelfe; the other takes part with conſcience againſt ſuch corrupt plea's.</p>

This is, for Gods love, to become his enemy; and to returne <hi>hatred for his good will.</hi> When a man finding that the moe and greater ſinnes God pardoneth, the more the glory of his grace and mercy is advanced, he ſhall upon that account make work for mercy by adding ſinne unto ſinne, this is to <hi>despiſe the riches of his goodneſſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and long ſuffering, all which ſhould lead him to repentance</hi>

                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian feares God moſt, when God is moſt kinde.</hi>

                        <hi>The feare of the Lord is his treaſure</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Eſay. 33.6</note>, as well as his <hi>wiſdom</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 111.18.</note>. And he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it his wiſdom, not only to <hi>praiſe the Lord for his goodneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 107.8.</note>, but <hi>to fear him and his goodneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Hoſ. 3.5.</note>, that is, <hi>for his goodneſſe.</hi> He is one of thoſe <hi>that loveth moſt,</hi> becauſe one to whom <hi>much is forgiven</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 7.43 and ver. 47.</note>. But the hypocrite <hi>to whom little is forgiven, loveth little,</hi> that is, not at all.</p>
                     <p>If the Hypocrite ſay, God is good, I may make therfore the more bold with him; the true Chriſtian ſaith, God is good, therefore I will feare him. If the hypocrite ſay, God loves me, therefore I will ſue out a diſpenſation to hate him, the Chriſtian will conclude the contrary, and ſay, if God love me, <hi>I will love him who loved me firſt</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 John 4.19</note>. If he cannot love God ſo much as he would, yet he is glad of pardon for not loving ſo much as he ſhould; and no leſſe deſirous of grace from God to ſerve God more, for the grace that he findes in God to be more and more towards him. He is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of grace given, becauſe that comes neereſt to the nature of God, and therefore is reſtleſſe, till through grace he hath augmented his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſets a price upon grace according to what it is likely to produce him in the matter of ſin; the true Chriſtian values grace according to what ſin it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to curb and ſuppreſſe.

                        <hi>This Hypocrite gathers arguments from outward bleſſings, that God approves of his <label type="milestone">

                        <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 10.3.</note>; yea, bleſſeth himſelf in his own wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ground of which unnatural evil is, another more natural, the over-prizing of theſe earthly things, as if outward proſperity were a thing ſo precious as none could have, but ſuch as are highly in Gods favour, whereas many times his enemies enjoy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63232:74"/> more thereof then his deareſt friends and followers. He conſiders not, that (as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> excellently,) God gives riches ſometimes to good men, that we may not ſuppoſe them to be ſimply evil; but, more often to evil men, that we might not conclude them to be abſolutely good. Therefore as the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe to give cenſure of actions from the temporal ſucceſſe; ſo this hypocrite conculdes favour from ſucceſſe; and if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe be ill (although in evil;) he is apt to complain of hard dealing: <hi>Wherefore have I faſted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? wherefore have I afflicted my ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge</hi>

                     <p>However others thrive in wickedneſſe, he dares not imitate them in ſinne, in hope of like ſucceſſe; nor to accuſe God of partiality, becauſe he fares not alike. If ſometimes he takes upon him with <hi>Jeremy</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Jerem. 12.1</note>, to <hi>plead with God,</hi> touching his judgements and ſtrange diſpenſations; he firſt layes down this for an irrefragable concluſion, <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou O Lord,</hi> although <hi>the way of the wicked proſper, and they are happy that deal very treacherouſly.</hi> What he cannot give a reaſon of, he will yet juſtifie; and, what he cannot fathome, he will with ſilence admire, not murmur at it.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph</hi> in a paſſion, ſtumble at <hi>the proſperity of the wicked;</hi> he will not impiouſly infer, that therefore <hi>the proud are happy;</hi> or, more in Gods books than the godly; but, from ſenſe and reaſon, by faith he appeals to <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> and there he <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands their end</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 73.17</note>, and ſoon puts an end to his envy &amp; folly in miſtaking their condition and Gods purpoſe towards them. There he findeth another <hi>Shekel</hi> to weigh his and their actions by, then to lay them in the ballance of ſucceſſe. He ſees the common proverb daily verified, that <hi>fortune</hi> (or rather providence) <hi>favours fooles,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in the end <hi>ſhall deſtroy them,</hi> and therefore he reſolves to be as farre from imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating as envying of them.</p>
                     <p>If at any time he compare his courſe with the event, he learneth this wiſdome. If in an evil courſe, evil befal him, he bleſſeth God who hath hedged his way with thornes <hi>and made a wall that he might not finde his paths</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6</note>, and thereby checkt, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. If good befall him in an evil way, he feareth that God <hi>hath given him over to his own luſt</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 81.10</note>, concluding that there can hardly be on earth a greater judgement than to do evil, and fare well. Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> trembled when he conſidered the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wit and parts in his baſe child, to think what God meant to him, infuſing ſo precious a ſoul in ſo impure a conception.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, if in a good courſe he thrives, he takes it as a favour that muſt oblige him, but not as evidence of ſo much love as may ſatisfie him: if he meet with evil in a good way, he will not alter his judgement of the righteouſneſſe of God, but rather ſuſpect himſelf guilty of ſome <hi>evil that with-holds good things from him:</hi> or that the things, though good, is not good for him; and that to him the <hi>yoke</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Lam. 3 27</note> is better then the ſtirrup. He will take it as a trial, not as a reproof; as an exerciſe of his faith, not as a diſcouragement in well-doing.</p>
                     <p>Thus the hypocrite as impious <hi>Domitian</hi> (who thought the gods favoured Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe he had ſuch a good gale of winde and weather, after he had robb'd their Temples;) thinks God likes well enough of proſperous wickedneſſe, becauſe he doth not preſently avenge it: the true Chriſtian knows that he hates it even when he doth moſt for him that commits it.

                     <p>Yet this hypocrite thinks he ſhould hate ſinne more, if he made ſome trial of it; and that tyring himſelf in ſinful pleaſures will bring on a more ſpeedy repentance: as if repentance ſerved but for an hoſpital for the lame and decrepit ſouldiers of ſinne. Hence he concludes, he may learn as much at a play, as by hearing a Sermon; for, in the one he ſhall ſee ſin acted, which will make him more to loath it; in the other he ſhall only hear it inveighed againſt, which will ſignifie little to any of the ſenſes, but only the eare. Hence he is content to let his children frequent play-houſes without control; yea, and brothel-houſes too, with little reproof, that by the ſight, or glut of ſin, they may be brought out of love with it.</p>

                     <p>But, in a play, ſaith he, there is good as well as evil repreſented?

                     </p>

                     <p>Therefore, he will not do evil that good may come of it. He will not tempt his concupiſcence to become an everlaſting temper to his heart; nor God, to give him over to the looſneſſe of it. He knows that whoſoever comes over to good, only becauſe he is weary of evil, will, after ſome reſt, returne to it; or repent, that he cannot; and that he that turnes <hi>the unclean ſpirit</hi> out of his houſe, upon no better account, and after findes it <hi>empty and ſwept</hi> of his former practiſes, and garniſhed with a ſhew of ſeeming reformation, he takes <hi>with himſelf ſeven ſpirits more wicked then himſelf, and they enter in, and dwell there, and the laſt end of that man is worſe then the firſt</hi>

                     <p>Nature may <hi>defervere</hi> wax cool: but luſt grows more hot: natural luſt may abate, but ſinful luſt encreaſeth her unnatural heat. Wherefore the childe of God is afraid to call to minde (unleſſe in a prayer) the ſinnes of his youth, even in repenting of

Much more then will he keep himſelfe farre from the publick ſhops of evil and perillous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, ſo leud, that neither a <hi>Cato</hi> can abide them, nor they him.</p>
                     <p>Thus the hypocrite out of love to ſin, would faine be fingering of it, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to loath it. The true Chriſtian truly loathing ſin, will not come neer it, out of love to God: the one ſeeks for light in the midſt of darkneſſe, for good in evil; the other will <hi>have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> becauſe <hi>a childe of light:</hi> that will not adventure to heaven it ſelf by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of hell.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He can eſpy and point at the ſmalleſt errours and infirmities in thoſe who in the main, out-ſtrip him in godlineſſe. He hath a quick-ſighted conſcience for other mens faults, but none for his own. And there is none whom he ſo much obſerveth, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, not to imitate, but to diſgrace and revile them; thereby declaring himſelf, not to be the Bee that gathers honey in Gods garden; but the ſpider that ſucks up the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Gods houſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence thoſe malicious out-cries, veiled over with a ſeeming ſorrow and amazement at the report; <hi>Wot you what? would you think it? ſuch an one</hi> (I heare) <hi>ſwore an oath,</hi> or <hi>was taken in a falſe tale: O! theſe pure ones; are the vileſt people alive; under a ſhew of ſanctity; they commit any wickedneſſe in the dark, &amp;c.</hi> But, doth not he the ſame things cuſtomarily, and with an high hand without any complaining of them in himſelf? <hi>Yes, but that's no matter; he makes no profeſſion to do contrary, the other doth contrary to his profeſſion:</hi> (If indeed he hath done it, and that rumour and malice have not conſpired, the one to raiſe, the other to receive an evil and unjuſt report.) But, is this hypocrites ſinne the leſſe, becauſe they who profeſs better, are guilty of the ſame? Will the others pollution waſh off this mans guilt, or excuſe him ſo much as <hi>à tanto,</hi> from any aggravating circumſtance, in the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>
                     <p>He eaſily beleeveth the worſt of profeſſors, not becauſe they are ſo bad, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will be no worſe: and that he may juſtifie or wreak himſelf (who is worſe) upon them, whom even at the worſt, he knows to be better then himſelf at his beſt: Faine he would have them to be what he reports them; and, is loath to hear any thing (how true ſoever) in their vindication. Of others he hopeth well beyond hope; but, here, where there is matter of more than hope, even real grace in being, he findes matter of exception; yea, of deſperation.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian deales only with himſelf by way of cenſure;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a way of charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath conſcience for himſelf, compaſſion for others; and while the hypocrites rules are looſe for himſelf, ſtrict for others, the Chriſtians ſeverity is moſt towards himſelf; and his charity largeſt towards others. He notes and bewailes the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt errour at home; but is loath to ſee farre greater abroad; not as conniving at ſinne, but as loath to turne his finger in other mens ſores. If others be his fellow profeſſours, he judgeth well of them, till plaine and full evidence compels him to alter his judgement. If they be looſe and unreformed, he mournes for them, and (which is all the favour that charity alloweth) he hopes, and prays for better.</p>
                     <p>He conſiders the occaſion, and the temptation, as well as the offence it ſelf; ſome he endeavours to <hi>reſtore with the ſpirit of meekneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>, <hi>having compaſſion, and making a difference</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Jude 22.</note>, others <hi>he ſaves with fear, pulling them</hi> with more violence <hi>out of the fire</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Verſe 23</note>. If their nakedneſſe be diſcovered, he labours to cover it with the mantle of love going backward, ſo far as Religion it ſelf do not ſuffer by undue palliating of it. His charity is ſuch, that of himſelf <hi>he thinkeh no evil;</hi> nor will he eaſily take <hi>up an evil report</hi> from others <hi>againſt his neighbour</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 15.3.</note>. Although his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p>Thus the hypocrite (like the lap-wing, that makes a great noiſe and fluttering, not over her neſt, but as far as ſhe can from it) ſets other mens faults between you and himſelf, that his own may not be diſcerned; the true Chriſtian will not hide his own iniquity, nor ſtand upon termes of comparative ſanctity with others. The one condemns ſin in others that he may juſtifie himſelf; the other lets other men alone, and condemnes himſelf that he may juſtifie God: the one concludes his own eſtate to be good, becauſe others be worſe; the other ſuſpects and fears his own <hi>ſtanding,</hi> when he ſees <hi>others to fall.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>As he maintaineth evil, not as evil, but as good: So he labours to knock down what is good, under the name and notion of evil. The Jews when they took up ſtones againſt Chriſt, would by no means be thought to do it for a good work: <hi>for a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſphemy, and becauſe thou, being a man makeſt thy ſelf God</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">John 10.33.</note>. Either he was a blaſphemer, or they will pronounce him ſo; and that, in their opinion was enough to make him ſo; although he was neither ſo, nor ſo.</p>
                     <p>Thus the blinde Phariſee was content to <hi>love thoſe that love him;</hi> but, to extend it to the love of <hi>enemies</hi> was, in his eſteem, a ſingularity, and more then needs; albeit Chriſt requires <hi>love</hi> to <hi>enemies, bleſſing</hi> for <hi>curſing, good</hi> for <hi>hatred,</hi> from all that would approve themſelves <hi>children</hi> of that <hi>Father who is in heaven</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 5.43, 44</note>. Thus <hi>Maries</hi> love and <hi>zeal</hi> in the <hi>anointing of Chriſt</hi> with a <hi>rich and precious ointment,</hi> againſt the time of his burial, was lookt upon by that hypocritical perfideous <hi>theefe</hi> and traitor, <hi>Judas,</hi> as a great and vain-glorious <hi>waſt,</hi> that might have been ſpared, and the <hi>ointment ſold,</hi> and employed to a better uſe<note n="e" place="margin">John 12.5.</note>; which yet Chriſt himſelfe pronounceth to be a <hi>good work</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 26.10</note>, and approved it ſo highly, that he took order, that <hi>where-ever that Gospel ſhould be preached in the whole world, there alſo ſhall this that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her</hi>

                     <p>He looks upon <hi>goodneſſe</hi> as a choice <hi>fruit of the Spirit</hi>

                     <p>When Chriſt, through ſuch a fervent zeal as in outward expreſſions, he never ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the like before or after, manifeſted his deep reſentment of the great profanation of the Temple by thoſe <hi>who ſold oxen, ſheep and doves,</hi> (and by the <hi>mony changers,</hi> who there attended upon that occaſion) to ſuch as at the ſolemn feſtivals came up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> for to worſhip; and by reaſon of the long journey, bought their offerings there with their money, which was allowed by the Law<note n="o" place="margin">Deut. 14 25</note>; but, not to be bought or ſold <hi>within the Temple,</hi> as then was the practiſe, whereupon our Lord in the height of his zeal, <hi>made ſcourges of ſmall cords,</hi> with which <hi>he drove</hi> all thoſe huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>out of the Temple, and the ſheep and oxen, and poured out the money, and overthrew the Tables</hi> on which the mony was told: this holy flame, his Diſciples did not (as our hypocrite would have done) cenſure as a piece of popular or frantick fury, but gave it the honour of an heavenly zeale, <hi>remembring that it was written, the zeale of thine houſe hath eaten me up.</hi>

It imports him that would caſt goodneſſe into chaines, to let wickedneſſe looſe to raiſe evil reports of the priſoner; but the childe of God lets grace go abroad as a good ſubject and ſervant to Chriſt, and ties up the remainder of corruption at home as a malefactor, and rebel to his Lord; and bewaile, his miſery in being forced to be a Jaylor to ſuch a priſoner that night and day ſtudies and ſtrives to break priſon; and cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death</hi>

He will not wholly diſclaime the World, but ſtrives to make good, even from the rules of Religion, his owning of it, ſo farre as he is willing to confeſſe his uſing of it.</p>
                     <p>No Wordling will acknowledge how much and how farre he <hi>minds earthly things,</hi> even when he condemneth others of the ſame ſin. He hath ſo many holes to run out at, when you purſue him, that it is hard to catch him: and Chamelion-like, he transforms himſelf into ſo many ſhapes, that it is no eaſie matter to lay hold upon him, and ſay <hi>this is the man,</hi> even when you have found him.

                     <p>This is He whom Chriſt intended in the Parable of the <hi>thorny ground</hi>

                     <p>He is a pretender to Religion (as all other hypocrites be) and many times more, than others who truly embrace it.

But his heart is altogether earthly, and acted by the World, a ſoyle, that never admitts of the ſeed of the Word, or of grace, but to ſtiffle or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it.</p>
                     <p>To Religion he pretends much love (but without ſincerity) in hope to corrupt her, to ſerve his worldly ends; but, to the World he is a ſlave, in regard, of the luſtful love he beares to her. He courteth Religion, but the World is his Miſtreſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither God, nor Religion can have any ſhare in his love. The love of the World, and the love of the Father are incompatible: Yea, <hi>the love</hi> of that, is <hi>enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with God.</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Jam 4.4.</note> This love of the World ſteales away the ſeed of the Word out of the heart, and the heart from God; and ſo makes the whole man <hi>to deny him</hi>

                     <p>If Popery prevail, and likely to be the quickeſt way to preferment, he hath preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arguments more than enow at his fingers ends to take him off from the true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, and to juſtifie his reconciliation to <hi>Rome.</hi> He finds ſo much diverſity and contrarietyes of opinions and parties, among Proteſtants, that he can bear it no longer.

In the mean time, he knows no more than the <hi>Collier,</hi> what that Church beleives, but to beleive as the Church believes, and to yield blind obedience to he knows not what, ſo it open a way to his thriving in the World, and to get up at Court.

                     </p>
                     <p>He embraceth Religion for Religions ſake: therefore if God once <hi>teach him the way of his ſtatutes, he will keep it unto the end,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119.33.</note> If he have once <hi>choſen the way of truth,</hi> he <hi>will ſtick unto Gods Teſtimonies,</hi>

                     <p>Thus, when he obſerveth the Worldlings enclination, by that inquiry, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> the true Chriſtian preſently makes out to God <hi>to lift up the light of his countenance upon him:</hi> thereby giving all to underſtand that if God ſhould deny him <hi>Corne, wine, and oyle,</hi> yet ſo long as he could but enjoy the ſpecial favour of God in Chriſt, that ſhould ſuffice.

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Job. 13.15.</note> He will not change his God for gold, nor his Religion to ſave his life.

And even thoſe outward bleſſings which God hath caſt upon him, in a lawful calling, he lookes upon more as the return of his prayers, than as the fruit of his labours; and is as willing to part with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63232:79"/> them all for God that beſtowed them, as he is to enjoy them while God ſeeth fit to continue them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite while he makes ſhew of greateſt honour to Religion, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who loved the <hi>Shrynes</hi> better then his <hi>Saint,</hi> and the <hi>Silver</hi> better then her <hi>Shrynes:</hi> the true Chriſtian, with <hi>David,</hi> loves Religion better then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Gold and Silver, and his God, better then his life: the one makes ſure of the world, whatever becomes of Religion; the other chooſeth to keep cloſe to Religion, whatever become of himſelf: The one conditioneth for plenty, and a great eſtate, the other is contented with a pilgrims allowance<note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 30.8.</note>.</p>

                     <p>Covetouſneſſe being conſcious, ſeekes ſhelter under ſomewhat that is either really good, or at leaſt ſeems to be ſo. Therefore <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> never walks without a <hi>Cloak,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he thinks himſelf guiltleſſe, if he can delude the world, whereas his guilt is the greater, by how much more artificial he is in maintaining his ſin. If he can prevaile ſo far as to procure <hi>the vile perſon to be called liberal, and the churle bountiful,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He looks upon them as that which would make him happy, and therefore deſireth them accordingly, not with condition, or ſubmiſſion; but, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as reſolving to take no nay; and, <hi>with all his might,</hi> that he may obtain them, whoever ſayes nay. He never putteth it to Gods wiſdom to conſider whether the things he deſireth be good for him, or not, but takes that for granted, how groſſely ſoever he be deceived There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Rachel,</hi> in paſſion, cried to her husband, <hi>Give me children, or elſe I dye</hi>

If he get riches, his heart is ſet upon them; if not, his heart ſinkes, and dies within him: ſo that being had, they bind him; not had, they torture him. <hi>So are the wayes of every one that is greedy of gain, which taketh away the life of the owners thereof</hi>

He is content to ſubſcribe to Gods wiſdome, and to put the matter wholly into Gods own hand: for though he may ſignifie in a prayer, what he conceiveth to be good, yet he leaves it to the wiſdome of God to diſpoſe otherwiſe, if God ſee cauſe. He placeth no happineſſe in the things of the world, and therefore is more moderate in ſeeking, and better ſatisfied in Gods denial of them. Therefore, when the world is reſtleſſe, God, ſaith the Pſalmiſt,<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 127.2.</note>

                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite ſets his heart on the world, to dote upon it as his happineſſe; the true Chriſtian hath the <hi>world in his heart,</hi> not to love it, but to ſee the vanity of it: the one perſues it as his greateſt care, the other neglects it, and caſteth all his care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.

                     <p>Firſt, he would faine have ſuch a thing; but it is not lawful. But is there no way to make it ſo; at leaſt in ſome caſes and conſiderations? He ſits not down by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, <hi>Non licet tibi, it is not lawful for thee to have her:</hi> but he goes on with the covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ask councel, how he may poſſeſſe himſelf of it. As men that have but a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken title, ſeek by the wit and cunning of a crafty Lawyer, to piece it up. Thus he ſeeth a field and coveteth it, but finding a barre, he ſuſpendeth the action, till the way ſeem to be cleared; and then having fetched a circle, and wheeled about, at the laſt he leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as a Lyon) upon his prey, upon the <hi>field</hi> and life of <hi>Naboth</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 King. 21.</note>.

                     <p>Of the ſame ſpirit and temper was that wretched worldling <hi>Balaam,</hi> who <hi>loved the wages of iniquity</hi> with all his heart; although at firſt he durſt not touch it, untill he had by importunity hoped to win over God to give way unto it. When he found not that anſwer from God which he expected, he makes great ſhewes of not dareing to go; yet, not without greater ſtruglings to obtain liberty of going. He, who pretended ſo much acquaintance with the true God (although a falſe prophet, and no better at beſt than a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who had heard too much of God to deny him; and, loved his own luſts too well, to obey him) as to conſult <hi>Jehovah,</hi> before he would give his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Princes of Moab</hi> ſent from <hi>Balaak</hi> with the <hi>reward of Divination in their hands;</hi> could not but imagine at leaſt, that he ſhould never obtaine from God a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to <hi>curſe</hi> thoſe whom the Lord had <hi>bleſſed</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63232:81"/> away, he now <hi>prayeth</hi> them (which he did not before) <hi>to tarry that night alſo, that he might know what the Lord would ſay unto him more.</hi>

                        <hi>Balaam</hi> hence gathereth hopes that he who at firſt denied him liberty to go and after granted it; would at laſt be drawn to give him power <hi>to curſe Iſrael,</hi> although at preſent he ſeemed to refuſe it.

                        <note n="l" place="margin">Num. 24.1.</note> Where he had often conſulted the Devil.</p>
                     <p>In all which he pretended ſtill to follow Gods command, whoſe reſolution he could not alter; But, rather then loſe all his paines, and hazards, and return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome reward, when he found God inexorable, he then (as a wretched hypocrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icall Worldling) betakes him to another ſtratagem; for by wicked counſell <hi>he taught Balack to lay a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and to commit fornication.</hi>

                     <p>Hereby <hi>Baalam</hi> obtained his end, being (as he wickedly imagined) now too hard for the Lord; putting a trick upon God, to make God to <hi>curſe</hi> thoſe himſelf, whom he would not ſuffer <hi>Baalam</hi> to curſe upon any intreaties. And thus, this Hypocrite will (as he thinkes) make that lawful and practicable at length, which he found moſt difficult, and boggled at, at the firſt: And, rather then faile, make God himſelf his Inſtrument, to do that which God will not ſuffer him to attempt: Not that God will be ſo mocked; but, that this hypocrite will do what he can thus to mock him.</p>

                     <p>Thus this Hypocrites eye is more then his belly, and both too great, to be thankful: the true Chriſtian is rather aſtoniſhed at the bounty which his eye beholdeth, and thinks his eye too greedy, when ſatisfied with the leaſt proportion: the one ſets too high a value upon his own ſervice; the other ſets all the price upon Gods bounty; the former, thinks much he hath no more; the other, breaks forth with admiration, <hi>Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought me hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                     <p>His ſorrows and troubles are not from men for his profeſſion of Religion, but from God for his hypocriſie in it; and, from his riches, through his Covetouſneſſe in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his evil conſcience in compaſſing of them.

                     <p>Thus this Hypocrite is as the brain which riſeth higher, or falleth lower in the brain-pan, as the Moon increaſeth or decreaſeth; the true Chriſtian is as the Sun that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one conſtant tenor of light and heat, even in the midſt of Winter: the one hath his chief dependance upon earth, and ſo is affected as that flowes in, or runs out from him; the other depending wholly upon God, lives upon him, when the earth failes him, and ſo rejoyceth always, although not always alike.</p>

                     <p>He hath this worlds goods ſo, as he is rather had of them as a conquered ſlave, then enjoyes them as a Maſter. He is even bridled, and ſaddled, and ridden by them, as the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

He looks upon the things of the world as lumber, not as his treaſure; and therefore keeps them off in out-roomes, and will not bring them into his Jewel-houſe or Treaſury, to take up room there, and to turn God and grace out of doors.</p>

Even when he ſeeth that <hi>wiſe men die, and fooles periſh and leave their wealth to others,</hi> whatever he may talk of leaving the world, yet <hi>his inward thought is, that his houſe ſhall continue for ever, and his dwelling place to all generations,</hi> and therefore he <hi>calleth his Lands after his own name</hi>

                     <p>He is like thoſe bad husbands that being never at home, yet wherever they be, they are never from home.

Wherefore, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwithſtanding his preferment to be the ſecond in the Kingdome, accounted himſelf a pilgrim, and <hi>gave Commandment concerning his bones</hi>

If God will let him carry the bagg and bottle himſelf, he is careful to preſerve it, and thankful for being truſted with it. If God will keep it in his own Land, he lookes on him as his Father, and doubts not but to live comfortably on his fathers allowance.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſmall portion which he craveth in this life, under the notion of <hi>daily</hi> bread, he uſeth it without diſtruſtful <hi>care for to morrow:</hi> and lookes upon it as his journal proviſion, not as his prepared inheritance. He would willingly ſerve God here, without worldly reward, which he never receives, but he lookes upon it as a debt, not from God that beſtowes it, but in himſelf that receives it. If he could here live of nothing of the world, that would pleaſe him as well, as if God gave him all things; but, ſeeing he cannot, he comforts himſelf with this, that he ſhall once do it in heaven. And ſo, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs, were firſt pilgrims in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and, after, Lords, in their poſterity: ſo this man is firſt a <hi>pilgrim</hi> here, and afterwards an inheritor in glory.<note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 2.26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he lookes upon it too, as Satans armory of tentations, as his ſhop of vanities, and pack of trinkets, where (like <hi>

In regard whereof the Chriſtian ſtandeth upon his guard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving not to truſt the world although he hold ſome correſpondence with it; holding commerce with it, but not ſeeking <hi>the friendſhip of it:</hi> He drinks of this brook in the way, as the dog doth of <hi>Nilus,</hi> running for feare of the <hi>Crocadile.</hi> He is like him that ſetting forth to Sea, looſeth ſight of the ſhore, as haſtening onwards all he can, to another Country, leſt Pyrates ſurprize him in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>

Wealth and friends (ſaith one) are no poſſeſſion to him that knows not how to uſe them; whereas enemies are beneficial to him that knows how to improve them.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he ſeemes to contemne them, but it is out of <hi>ignorance,</hi> or a <hi>worldly heart.</hi> Out of <hi>ignorance</hi> when he would be thought to deſpiſe the world, he knows not why, nor wherefore, as they ſpeak: as Country-men cry out againſt courtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

                     <p>Sometimes he doth thus, <hi>with a worldly heart</hi> that aimes at what he ſeemes to deſpiſe, and therefore deſpiſeth them, becauſe he cannot hope to compaſſe them. For, as the <hi>Parthian,</hi> in his warres was wont to <hi>ſhoot,</hi> and fly, all at once; So this hypocrite ſhootes at the world in hope to gain it, even when he flyes it, under pretence of contemning it. Either he makes himſelf poore and ſeemes to deſpiſe the world, when he hath great riches and hawkes at more; or if he be poor, without hope to be rich, there is the more reaſon to ſuſpect his contempt, as proceeding from envy, or as ſavouring of the foxes humour; that deſpiſed the grapes becauſe he could not come at them. Thus divers, when fallen into diſgrace, have written of the contempt of the Court, and bidden adieu to the world; not as being above it, but as having loſt themſelves in it, without hope of recovering their former luſtre.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he condemnes them as ſimply evil, becauſe he will not be at the charge and trouble to keep them. Worldly things bring with them both a delight, and a charge. This hypocrite will be quit of the one rather then undergo the other; as <hi>Democritus</hi> who left his landes and ſuffered them to be laid common, and waſte, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be troubled to manure and improve them. <hi>Crates</hi> would rather drown his ſilver in the Sea, than be in danger by keeping it, to be drowned by it: as if there were no way to eſcape drowning in perdition, but the deſtroying of innocent ſilver, which might have been a refreſhing to many, and a comfort to him, had he ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it. Thus, ſome refuſe the comforts of life, becauſe others abuſe them; not conſidering the root of the abuſe to be in thoſe that pervert them, not in the things which are ſo abuſed; and ſo they ſin as much in not uſing what God freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth, as they who abuſe what was given to a better purpoſe. <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſinned as much, and <hi>tempted God</hi> as farre in refuſing <hi>a ſigne</hi> when God bade him <hi>ask</hi> it,<note n="e" place="margin">Jſa. 7.11.12.</note> as they who <hi>except they ſee ſignes and wonders, will not</hi> beleive:<note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 4.44..</note> both being hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in grain.</p>
                     <p>Thus is he in and out, up and down, both in their uſe and value, ſetting his own price upon them without weighing them aright, or bringing them to the teſt of the Word. And although it be natural to ſeveral complexions to differ in their rates of worldly things, ſome ſetting leſſe by one thing, ſome by another; (as, the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick</hi> perſon ſets light by <hi>pleaſures;</hi> the <hi>Sanguine,</hi> by profits, the <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> by <hi>fame;</hi> the <hi>Cholerick,</hi> by ſafety;) yet it is not ſo much natural inclination, as a perverſe diſpoſition and choice in this hypocrite, to weigh all in his own ballance; to value all by his own eſtimate, or at leaſt by the opinion of others, rather than by the ſtandard of God, or the rate which God puts upon it: and, to take the worlds own word for the price, rather than to go to God to know the true worth of the things.</p>

He is as the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> able to give a reaſon of his refuſal of great things in the World, which the <hi>bramble</hi> ignorantly embraceth.<note n="i" place="margin">Judg. 9.</note> Shall he leave the ſtate of grace, his ſweet communion with God and the hope of glory, for a little worldly pelfe, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Worldling knoweth not what the child of God embraceth, but the child of God knoweth what the World either vainly magnifieth, or ignorantly refuſeth: Yea further, he knowes not only the good of them, but how to uſe them to profit: how to want them without damage, and how to abound in them without ſin; to want without murmuring, and to abound without abuſe. He compareth the good with the evil; and underſtandeth not only the ſlippery condition to which they are ſubject, but the dangerous tentations to which they expoſe him: therefore he is more afraid of <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> then of <hi>want,</hi> as knowing there are more that, being <hi>full, deny God, and ſay who is the Lord;</hi> than through <hi>poverty, ſteale, and take the Name of God in vaine.</hi>

                     <p>He ſheweth his Contempt of the World by his ſober uſe thereof: and, as Navigators have learned to take the height of the Sun, by the ſhadow, without a direct aſpect which might dazel and indanger their ſight, ſo the true Chriſtian takes the eſtimate of worldly things, by a ſafe and harmleſſe experience of their vanity, without endangering himſelf by too much gazing upon the Luſtre and Splendor of them.</p>
                     <p>When he contemneth them, it is only for the abuſe, not as being unlawful to be uſed. He ſo contemneth them, that he yet eſteemeth them good in their kind: and, ſo rejecteth them, that he retayneth an honourable memory of Gods bounty in them. He conſidereth their uſe as well as the abuſe; and that they are talents as well as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Therefore, if God will, he receiveth them; while God will, he keepeth them; as God will, he employeth them: and when God will, he willingly parteth with them, as glad to give up his account, and to receive a diſcharge. And as for, the abuſe, he knoweth the World to be vain, therefore not to be loved; and evil, therefore not to be truſted; yet ſo far as, through mercy, God makes it a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled enemy,</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Job. 5.23. Prov. 16.7.</note> it may profitably (if warily) be employed.</p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>price,</hi> which is ſet upon earthly Commodities, he weigheth the world in one ſcale, and heaven in another: for no man can judge rightly of either, but he that weigheth both together, and obſerveth the difference of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe. Nor will any ballance ſerve for this trial but that of the ſanctuary. Thither will he therefore go, and there he ſhall <hi>underſtand</hi> the difference between the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and the true Beleever by the ends of both.<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 73.17.</note> This ballance will ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Tekel,</hi> upon the World, as finding it <hi>too light</hi>

                     <p>He knoweth that worldly things weighed by themſelves may be eſteemed as every man will, that hath a mind to be deceived: but, compared with heavenly, God himſelf muſt award the difference. Every man may ſet price upon Counters, and reckon them for as much as he pleaſeth, but only Kings ſet rates upon Coyne: ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may value worldly things, but heavenly things have their price, as well as their worth only from Chriſt, and from thoſe who in him are made Kings, and know how to rate them. And, in rateing, the Chriſtian conſidereth theſe differences in good things, ſome, the World can both <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>take away,</hi> as <hi>wealth, and honour;</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:63232:86"/> ſome, it can give, but not take away, as <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>skill:</hi> ſome, it can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but not give, as <hi>life and health:</hi> ſome, it can neither give, nor take away, as <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> Of all which, thoſe are better, over whom the World hath leſſe power, and thoſe beſt, over which the world and the God of the world have none, and which the God of heaven himſelf will neither take away or <hi>withhold</hi>

                     <p>He ſeemes much incenſed with this preſent World as an <hi>enemy to God,</hi> yet never ſeekes in truth to make God his friend. He is weary of this World, rather for the croſſes and troubles of it, than for the ſweetneſſe and comfort he finds in God. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forſook (and after repented their forſaking) <hi>the fiſh which they eat freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the mellons, the leekes, onions, and garlike.</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Num. 11.5.</note> Without taking hold (ſo ſolidly and effectually as they ought) of the promiſe of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and therefore, not only murmured, but quarrelled at every croſſe providence which met them by the way: and ſo, in their own opinions at leaſt, were not gainers, but loſers by leaving <hi>Egypt.</hi> No man leaveth the World to his profit, that did not firſt take hold of God. He that cleaves to the World as a friend, is an enemy to God: and he that leaves the World, not having made his peace with God, is an enemy to himſelf; like him that being at Sea, ſets fire on his Ship, before he come to his harbour; or, caſteth off an old friend, before he make ſure of a new.</p>
                     <p>This can be no true or comfortable contempt of the World, which is made without laying hold of another of more worth. And although it be not the letting go of the ſubſtance to catch a ſhadow; yet, it is the parting with a ſhadow without hope of a ſubſtance; and ſo, to loſe all for nothing. To contemne riches for <hi>fame,</hi> life for <hi>honour,</hi> pleaſure for <hi>pride,</hi> and all, to have his will; is but to exchange one World for another; a bad, for a <hi>worſe;</hi> and, to add folly to his pride, ſin to his miſery; and, to put himſelf into a condition of ſin out of meaſure ſinful, and, into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of miſery beyond expreſſion miſerable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian never parts with this World, but he is ſure of a better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He can let go his lead, when he is ſure of gold in the room. He is not ſo unwiſe, as to forſake the World for nothing: nor ſo fooliſh as to part with a preſent in-come, for a more uncertain revenue. If he ſhake hands with periſhing things, it is becauſe he is ſure of <hi>more durable riches and honour;</hi> or, at leaſt, hath them in his eye, and makes towards them with all his might, not without more than probability of ſucceſſe. Although he be a plain man as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, yet he is not ſo ſimple, as to part with his <hi>pottage,</hi> untill he had bargain'd for the <hi>birth-right.</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 25.33 34.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is not a Pilgrim for nothing; or, barely to ſee ſights, and make viſits, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens profit more than his own; to enrich the Prieſts who ſhew him reliques, with impoveriſhing of himſelf by his travels and offerings. But, as <hi>ſeeking a Country,</hi> a <hi>better Country; that is, an heavenly;</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Heb. 11.16.</note> not ſo much to coaſt it, as to enjoy it. An houſe and a Country, every man muſt have, if not other where, then <hi>here;</hi> ſo ſaith the Worldling: If not here then <hi>elſewhere,</hi> ſo ſaith the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Thus this hypocrite while he confeſſeth a bird in the hand to be worth two in the buſh, lets go that in his hand, without hope of ſo much as one in the buſh. The true Chriſtian makes ſure of better than of two in the buſh, before he part with that in his hand, how meanly ſo ever eſteemed by him. The one, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> parts with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63232:86"/> his birth-right, without making ſure of <hi>the bleſſing;</hi> the other, as <hi>Jacob</hi> had an eye to the bleſſing, before he would part with ſo much as a meſſe of pottage to purchaſe the birth-right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Hypocrite, when it comes to ſpending, or giving, gives words rather than <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes he is called upon for a work of charity, or piety; and, knowing how infamous <hi>Nabal</hi> ſtill is, for a flat denial of ſupply to <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.</note> he will ſeem to do ſomewhat, although that ſomething be nothing. And albeit good words do butter no parſnips (as, in the proverb;) yet words are the beſt gift he meanes to beſtow, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſt cheap, and of ſome uſe to put off a ſuitor, if not to ſave his own credit. <hi>If a brother, or ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily food,</hi> He ſaith unto them, <hi>depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled,</hi> but <hi>gives them nothing that is needful to the body,</hi> to do it with all<note n="y" place="margin">Jam. 2.15.16</note>.

                     <p>He that moſt paſſionately wayleth over his neighbours miſery, and helpeth him not, is like him that with teares looketh on the lively acting of a Tragedy, yet mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for them whoſe miſery is then repreſented.

                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtians hand out-doeth his tongue.</hi>

                     <p>His hand ſhall be doing, where his tongue is ſilent <hi>his almes</hi> ſhall be real, but without a <hi>Trumpet.</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 6.2.</note> If it be a private charity, he is ſo farre from blazing it with his tongue, that he keepes ſecret from <hi>the one hand what is done by the other,</hi>

                     <p>In promiſing he is ſlow, but yet not ſlothful in doing more than he thinks fit to promiſe. In <hi>doing</hi> of <hi>good</hi> (which <hi>he never forgets</hi>) he is as quick as <hi>Jacob</hi> in providing <hi>ſavory meat</hi> for his aged father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo ſoon as the <hi>Lord brings it to his hand.</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 27, 20.</note> He would not put off his father, by ſaying, <hi>it is Corban</hi> that is <hi>a gift by whatſoever thou mayſt be profited by me</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 15.5.</note>; but <hi>honoureth his father and mother,</hi> as his father, and mother. And delights more in doing his duty, then his parents can in receiving his ſupply.</p>
                     <p>Nor, is he only for natural relations, but <hi>does good unto all, eſpecially to the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of faith</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>, and he not only worketh good, but <hi>is rich in good works;</hi> not taking his ſcantling by the practiſe of others who perhaps are behind him in eſtates; but, from thoſe who go furtheſt in workes of piety and charity, or rather from God himſelf, <hi>who is kind to the unthankful and evil.</hi>

                     <p>Thus, the hypocrite is like <hi>ſounding braſſe or a tinkling Cymbal,</hi> that make a loud noiſe, but nouriſh not: the true Chriſtian is as the ſilent raine that refreſheth the earth when it is weary, no man ſcarce knowing how: The one is as <hi>Ziba</hi> making larg promiſes to <hi>David,</hi>

But whatever it be, he payes it out of Gods purſes, not his own. If he be rated to ſome extraordinary aſſeſſement, he thinks it now no robbery <hi>to rob God in tythes</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Mal. 3.8.</note>, and <hi>to pinch on the Parſons ſide</hi> (as the ſaying is) to make up his extraordinary payments, out of Gods part.</p>
                     <p>He will favour, at leaſt, connive at ſwearing, ignorance, prophaneneſſe, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. in his ſervants, if he may have the more work for the leſſe wages. He can ſuffer them to make bold with the Lords day, that they may look for no eaſe or liberty all the week after: and divers ſuch arts he hath, to get love and praiſe, and to ſpare his purſe.</p>
                     <p>He giveth the world to God, but with condition that God ſhall reſtore it to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with intereſt. As Monks leave private eſtates, to live like Princes on the revenues of their Covent; ſo this hypocrite ſeems very willing to part with a piece of his eſtate, in hope to get more by parting with it, then he could have expected by keeping of it.</p>
                     <p>He entertaineth ſuch of whom he may make benefit, with all manifeſtations of love and ſtrength of affection: but, in the next bargain or contract, they ſhall be ſure to pay a deere ſhot; as gueſts in an Inne, that pay ſoundly for all their good words and welcome, as well as for what proviſions they called for. He inviteth thoſe who will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him again to better fare: or, at leaſt commend and applaud him for his noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. He ſometimes gives gifts and preſents, but with hope that all his gifts after the fetching of a compaſſe, will return with advantage. He lets his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney fly, as boyes do Kites, in a ſtring, that when he will, he may ſay (and make good his ſaying) <hi>retraham ad me illud fugitivum argentum:</hi> I will draw in to me that fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſilver. Even almes are made a Merchandize, when given for ſome mans ſake, that muſt owe a good turn to him or his that giveth them. And his purpoſe of a work of charity hereafter, is proclaimed with a trumpet, to bear out his preſent bribery, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which otherwiſe would not be endured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian will ſpend, and be ſpent for God, without reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He advanceth Gods ſervice, although with his own detriment. He will not ſerve God with that which coſt him nothing; but, accounts all as nothing which he ſpends in Gods ſervice. He will not pull down a ſtone of Gods, to build up his own houſe; but chooſeth rather to pull down his own, to build up Gods. He is affraid of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in himſelf, more then of luxury in others: becauſe the one, if committed, will coſt him deer: the other, if proved, will light only on others. And as for private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, he ſeeketh the beſt ſervants, not the beſt cheap: the beſt for Gods honour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not beſt for his own profit in a worldly way: yet not without hope, that while God is honoured, himſelfe ſhall be better ſerved, and obtaine a bleſſing by meanes of his ſervant, although not ſo profitable in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He casteth his bread upon the waters</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.1.</note>, not as careleſly ſquandring, or profuſely laviſhing it where there is no need, but giving it where there is need, although no likelihood of return. In <hi>Almes,</hi> he reſpecteth rather humanity than the man, his duty rather then the others deſert; nature more then the goodneſſe of the receiver; and grace, above both. He gives, out of love to God, for which Chriſt himſelf will be the debtor, and pay-maſter; and is loth to be paid here, to the prejudice of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In invitements, he is more in inviting thoſe that cannot invite him againe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſometimes invites others, to maintain friendly neighbourhood, and to cheriſh love. He had rather be ſtill doing good, living, that his works may follow him dying; then to delay doing good, till after he can do no more evil; and, that his whole converſation ſhould be honeſt, and praiſe him in the gate, rather then hope to get fame by ſome one action, after he is ſetled in his long home.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite, in ſerving of God, ſerveth none leſſe; the true Chriſtian in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63232:87"/> doing ſervice, accounts it both his gain and honour to ſerve God moſt: The one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it detriment to be at charge for God, the other eſteems it his greateſt gain to lay out any thing for him.

                     <p>He findeth the curſe of <hi>Simon Magus, (thy money periſh with thee</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the true Chriſtian holds faſt his comforts,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As his hopes, ſo his comforts depend not on tranſitory things: therefore when earthly things vaniſh, he is not troubled, becauſe that whereon his hopes and comforts are built, periſheth not, but ſtands by him for ever.

                        <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 73.26.</note>. He hath alwayes his <hi>meditata in commoda,</hi> his premeditated diſaſters, ſo as he looks upon theſe things as loſt, even while he enjoyes them; and, by that means, enjoyes himſelf, when theſe come to be loſt. He is impoveriſhed, and dieth every day in the preparation of his heart; and ſo, by dying daily, the <hi>bitterneſſe of death is past,</hi> before it come at him; and the diſcouragement of poverty is over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come upon him, ſo that it comes not as <hi>an armed man;</hi> but, as ſpoiled of its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſo does him no hurt.</p>
                     <p>He remembers that the more and longer uſe he hath had of theſe worldly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, the nearer the time of his parting with them approacheth: and that it were great ingratitude to think much of reſtoring the borrowed thing. And, becauſe he ſerved not God for them, he can the better, with <hi>Job,</hi> both ſerve and truſt God without them.</p>
                     <p>He needs not fear a ſtorme that is above the <hi>Moon;</hi> nor he to be troubled with fear of nakedneſſe that is <hi>clothed with the Sun.</hi> He that is owner of large Territories, need not break his heart nor his ſleep, becauſe ſome one cottage in it is burnt to aſhes; nor he that is heire to heaven, to be bereft of his comforts, becauſe things on earth go not ſo well as he would have them. Did his life conſiſt in theſe things, there were ſome cauſe to be troubled; but ſeeing he can live without them, why ſhould he dye for them? It was <hi>Jonah's</hi> paſſion (unworthy of a Prophet, yea of an ordinary believer) not his faith becoming the meaneſt Chriſtian, to be ſo angry for the withering of his <hi>gourd,</hi> of which the true Chriſtian takes warning, that he fall not into the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.</p>
                     <p>He that can willingly endure the ſpoiling of his goods by men, will patiently bear, when God takes poſſeſſion of his own, without his prejudice that parteth with it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite when God takes any thing from him, he runs after it, crying, as <hi>Micah</hi> after the <hi>Danites,</hi> when they carried <hi>away his gods</hi>

                     <p>And, as an ill Tenant payes his rent with an ill-will, ſo this man ſo much envies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are likely to enjoy what he unwillingly parteth with all, that he had rather ſay with him in the Tragedy, <hi>Me mortuo terra miſceatur incendi</hi> (when I am dead, let the fire take all) then do as <hi>Hezekias</hi> was required, to prevent ſuch confuſion. As a ſwine that is next in election to make puddings, alone cries, when all about him are merry: So dyes the worldling, who doing no good in his life, was loth to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of death, till thoſe that ſurvive him, enjoy his leavings, with more trouble then profit in what he leaves to them.

                     <p>We ſpeak of him as acted by faith, not as overſwayed by paſſion. When he is himſelf, he ſpeaks and doth like himſelf. He can think and talk of his departure, as freely as he that is taking a journey, of which he hopes to reap benefit.

                     <p>He is not ſo much affected to think what he muſt part with to others, as joyful to conſider what he is going unto. And although for ſome reaſons he may be willing to live, yet farre greater are thoſe that make him contented to die. He is careful ſo to order his eſtate, that the ſtrivings of the living may not be imputed to the negligence of the dead. He loveth, pitieth, and prayeth for thoſe, to whom theſe doubtful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine dangerous things are to be reſigned, but he loves himſelf better then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to live longer, to keep the others out of poſſeſſion: and when all men are ſorry to think of his departure, he only is not ſorry for himſelf. Nor doth he fear or delay to make his Will, leaſt that ſhould be ſpeak his change the ſooner; but rather haſtens the ſetling of his worldly eſtate, that afterwards he may have nothing more to do but to ſettle the eſtate of his ſoul. He that hath done the former will be not only at more leaſure, but in a better frame of ſpirit to ſet about the other, that he may alwayes be fit to die, and to prevent ſudden death, how ſuddenly ſoever death ſeize on him. So, while he lives, he will live more uſefully, and when he dies, he will dye more comfortably.</p>

He holds out nothing for godlineſſe, but that which is ſo indeed, if the <hi>power and life</hi> of what he holds out in the <hi>forme,</hi> were added to his <hi>profeſſion.</hi> He <hi>runnes well</hi> in regard of the race propounded, and of the <hi>truth</hi> profeſſed; but yet there is ſomewhat that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (to wit, his beloved luſt within,) that he doth <hi>not obey the truth</hi>

He hath a <hi>forme of godlineſſe,</hi> that he may not be thought profane, nor be excluded the ſociety of the godly; but, he hath but a <hi>forme,</hi> and therefore is but a profane wretch, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the true communion of Saints. We therefore may fitly call him <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Hypocrite: Religious,</hi> becauſe he makes a <hi>ſhew</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> yet, an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> becauſe this is but a <hi>ſhew,</hi> without the life and power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the ſincere Chriſtian is as careful to expreſs the power of godlineſs,</hi>

                     <p>He is not careleſs of the <hi>forme,</hi> but carefull to enquire after it, and to embrace, and retain it.

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note>; for the Doctrine of Chriſt is no ſooner delivered to him, but <hi>he delivers up himſelfe unto it,</hi> to be moulded and aſſimilated into the nature of it, that where the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he may be Goſpelized, as that which is caſt in a mould beareth the figure and print of the mould; and that which is caſt into the fire is converted into the colour, heat, and properties of the fire. He looks upon the Goſpel not only as the <hi>effigies</hi> and true pourtraiture of Chriſt, but as his <hi>glory alſo:</hi> and ſo is <hi>transformed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi>

                     <p>He puts on Religion not as liking it for it ſelf, but as needing it for his carnal ends: and men uſe to meddle as little as they can with things they like not; although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they muſt uſe them in order to ſomewhat elſe, which cannot be had without them. Therefore, as a <hi>Stage-player</hi> puts on the name and habit of a King, for an hour or two, but ſtill retaines the heart and quality of a <hi>Rogue:</hi> So this man appeareth in a vizar and robe of Religion, not as his wearing apparel, but as beſt ſuiting with his deſignes and occaſions; not as being anſwerable to his practiſe, but as moſt conducing to his ends: Not as fitting his perſon, but his purpoſe, for which he put it on: not as <hi>ſerving the time,</hi> for Gods ſake; but, the Lord, for the times ſake.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Christian puts on Religion as his wearing apparel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>He puts on Religion not only to cover his nakedneſſe, but to adorne his perſon.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63232:90"/> He is careful that it ſhould ſuit, not ſo much emergent occaſions, as his place, calling, qualities, and relations: yea, that it ſhould be as his skin (of all other, the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cloathing) when food digeſted turnes into <hi>cloathing</hi> by nutrition, and augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, thus the child of God receiveth the Word, to be not only <hi>meat and drink,</hi> but <hi>cloath</hi> alſo unto him. For, by digeſting it inwardly, he feels it without as well as within, and is cloathed without, becauſe nouriſhed within; the skin is fed and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood in the veines; and ſo both profeſſion, and practiſe are made correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: when he is made <hi>glorious within,</hi> he is <hi>comely without:</hi> nor can he be more without the glory within, than the rayment of needle work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                     <p>Thus the one putteth on Chriſt, without taking him in; the other firſt takes in Chriſt, and then puts him on: the one, as <hi>Tamar,</hi> puts it on as a diſguiſe, to couſen <hi>Judah,</hi>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is his ſtalking-horſe to bring him to his game: but it ſets ſo hard to his luſts, that could he compaſſe his ends without it, he would never be troubled with it.

                     <p>It goes againſt the hair with him to walk in Gods wayes, even when he finds it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to look that way. He is for the time out of his own way, while he is in Gods; and, hath loſt himſelf till he be in his old bias again. Yet, as travellers, for pleaſure care not much to go a mile or two out of their own way for company, eſpecially if the way be fair, and the company pleaſing: So this Hypocrite, if he meet with no diſtaſte or oppoſition, and can accompliſh his own ends the better, he will be content (if it be but for more ſafety upon the way) to take a walk, in that way which is neither his own nor very pleaſing to him. But, if there be no ſuch inducement, or, if beyond that induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is no way for him, who will rather tarry at home, or part company, to keep on his own courſe.</p>

                        <note n="k" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.25.</note>. Not that every truth is not precious to him, but that he believes the entring the liſts of contention with every gain-ſayer upon every challenge, or provocation, is none of the beſt wayes, either to find truth, if loſt, or to keep it when it is found: but rather, that more truths are loſt in the ſcuffle of contention, than found by wrangling oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite is all for <hi>borrowing,</hi> and <hi>payeth not again,</hi> having nothing of his own; the true Chriſtian is as much for lending, as borrowing, and where he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, he makes a return with intereſt, having enough of his own to do it; The one, with the Phariſee, bears himſelf out upon his Anceſtors title, <hi>We have Abraham to our Father</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>What duties others obſerve, and obſerve him for, he is punctual in the external ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of them. If prayer be more cried up than preaching; he will not miſſe prayers,

                     <p>He doth holy duties with others; but not as others, not as the children of God. In matters of forme he is curious, but in matters of ſubſtance, careleſſe. He makes ſcruple to be abſent from Church, becauſe that would be a thing noted, and he perhaps pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for it, but he makes no conſcience at all how he behaves himſelf in the Church, whether he hear, or <hi>offer the ſacrifice of fooles</hi>

                     <p>He putteth on that part of religion which is moſt in eſteem and faſhion; but regardeth it not much whether that become him, or he it, ſo he wear it when he goes abroad, as his mantle or looſe garment which he may caſt off at pleaſure when he comes home. And indeed clothes beſt faſhioned will never become a miſ-ſhapen body, nor true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo crooked a ſoul. And how can any thing ſit cloſe about him, who wanteth the <hi>girdle of verity</hi> to gird it on?

                     <p>If Religion be in favour, he may ſometimes court it, and do ſomewhat for it, as <hi>Joab</hi> for <hi>Abſolom</hi>

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 1.6.</note>, as well as bear them <hi>reſpect;</hi> as knowing that <hi>not the hearers of the Word, but the doers of the work ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> He is reſpectful of all outward duties, but moſt careful of the inner man, and of the inward part of the duty; of the ſoul and life of the duty, as well as of the body of it.</p>
                     <p>He doth as others in publique duties, but not without a diſpoſition and frame of heart peculiar to the upright and ſincere Chriſtian. He refraines not the Congregation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome <hi>Ahitophels</hi> are permitted to the Ordinances, no more than Chriſt excluded <hi>Judas</hi> from his ſociety at his laſt ſupper. <hi>He goeth with others to the houſe of God</hi>

                     <p>He maketh conſcience of thoſe duties whereof none but God and his own heart can be witneſſes, as well as of thoſe upon which every one hath his eye: and of the manner of doing, as well as of the matter of the duty to be done by him; eſpecially that it be done <hi>in ſpirit and in truth</hi>

                     <p>Thus, the Hypocrite takes up Religion, becauſe it is in faſhion; the true Chriſtian rejoyceth that it is in faſhion; and endeavours to bring it into faſhion where it is not, the one will pick and chooſe, the other will take in all, becauſe he <hi>hath choſen the way of truth:</hi> the former minds the faſhion more then religion, the other minds religion more than the faſhion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever his grounds of his profeſſion were at the beginning, he now hath either forgotten them, or laid them aſide, yet holds on his courſe upon this ground, chiefly and commonly, becauſe he will do as he hath done. He once made ſhew of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to pray at ſet times in his family; or, privately: now, being rooted in the love of the world, his affections are cooled, and conſcience corrupted, yet the order remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu, non ſenſu gratias agit;</hi> he ſayes grace by uſe, not out of ſenſe of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as <hi>Bernard</hi> well. And in the performance, he hath good words, and formes by rote, into which he falleth of courſe without thinking what he ſaith. It is but the exerciſe of the phantaſie, not of faith; as ſome men in their ſleep walk in the way which they uſed waking.</p>
                     <p>Even Gods children ſometimes are guilty of this decay, or abatement (as <hi>Epheſus</hi>) of <hi>their firſt love</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 2.4.</note>; but they continue not in it, but recover. Sometimes they pray out of cuſtome, but it is not their cuſtome ſo to pray. Haply, once, for love of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> the hypocrite ſets himſelf a pitch or courſe in giving, or in uſing Hoſpitality; thus many he would relieve, thus much he would allow; now, though it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his mind, and cometh from him, not cheerfully, but with much grudging, yet he holds on: he cannot yet ſo far prevaile with his credit, or conſcience, as to break the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
                     <p>He once engaged himſelf by promiſe or proteſtation, not to take or give a bribe, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o make a ſymoniacal contract, nor to multiply charges and cures of ſouls. Now, if that were to do, he would not begin to make ſuch promiſes: but, (as <hi>Herod</hi> in the caſe of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> head) becauſe he ſtands engaged, and an expectation is raiſed of him, he muſt do no other. There are not, I confeſs, many of theſe ſcrupulous Hypocrites, for it were not for the Devils profit: yet, ſome there be, with whom he is content to bear, till he can win them to be worſe.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian performs duty out of an abidnig ſeed of goodneſſe in him.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He that is born of God, hath the ſeed of God remaining in him</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">1 John 3.9.</note>. This not only keeps him off from <hi>reigning</hi> ſin, but is the ground of his duty. He is careful to maintain a good courſe, as well as forward to begin it. Yea more, becauſe Satan is a greater enemy to our ſtanding, than to our entrance, for he getteth much by ſuch muſhroomes as are up in a might, and waſted in a day. If he can once ſet a worm in the <hi>Gourd,</hi> he knowes how much <hi>Jonah</hi> will take on, and talk as malepertly to God<note n="c" place="margin">John 4.8.</note>, as the Devil himſelf could.

                     <p>Therefore is the Chriſtian careful to maintaine his firſt grounds, as well as his firſt growth; <hi>his firſt love,</hi> as well as <hi>his firſt works</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 2.5.</note>. He will not be <hi>ſo fooliſh, as having begun in the ſpirit</hi>

                     <p>Our Saviour deſcribeth this Hypocrite by the ſimilitude of a bad <hi>Husband-man,</hi> that <hi>putteth his hand to the plough, and after looks back</hi>

Therefore, he ſets himſelf a pitch, beyond which he will not go. His <hi>looking back</hi> ſo ſoon, ſhews he hath no mind to go forwards; but rather, repents that he hath gone ſo farre.</p>
                     <p>In three kinds of examples three ſorts of <hi>Stinted</hi> profeſſors are noted in the Goſpel<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 9.</note>. <hi>One,</hi> that would <hi>follow Chriſt whetherſoever he ſhould go;</hi> but repented, as being diſcouraged at the coarſe fare and hard lodging (ſhort of the proviſion of <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Birds of the aire</hi>

To him, and to the reſt Chriſt gives but one Anſwer, which in effect was, that in his ſervice there is no place for ſuch deliberation, delay, or tergiverſation. He that layes hold on this <hi>Plough,</hi> muſt never let it go, nor ſo much <hi>as look behind him.</hi> For, <hi>where thou lookst back, thou art in danger</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

                        <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when <hi>Elijah</hi> had caſt his <hi>Mantle upon him,</hi> deſired leave <hi>to kiſſe his Father and Mother</hi>

But, the hypocrite alledgeth theſe things, <hi>animo cunctandi,</hi> with a deſire to linger, that he may ſhift off the ſervice with reputation. The ſervice of Chriſt is a ſpiritual tillage, both in regard of our general calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every man muſt <hi>plow his own ground</hi>

                     <p>Every Profeſſor putting an hand to this <hi>Plough,</hi> enters Covenant with Chriſt, to be not only of his retinue, but his houſhold ſervant; not, to chooſe his own work or to ſet a ſtint to his labours; but to put his hand to whatever his Maſter requireth; and, to work all day, <hi>till the night cometh,</hi> in which there can be no working. But, the Hypocrite like a loytering and unfaithful hind, looks over his ſhoulder, as afraid to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63232:93"/> over-work himſelf, or to bring in too much gain to his Maſter: and therefore ſits down and thinks, <hi>what a dayes work have I done!</hi> It is time to unyoke, leſt I over-do. Even when he entreth into Gods ſervice, he caſteth beforehand, what, and how much ſervice he will do, and where he will make a ſtop; as a coward that thinks of the retreat, before he give the onſet.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He likes not to travel with company too high metled for his more reſty temper, leſt he be tired: Yet, if an ordinary pace will be accepted, he is content to make one in the journey.

As in ringing, men that love their eaſe as well as the ſport, will take the <hi>ſtint</hi> Bell, becauſe then they can lead, riſe, and fall as they liſt, and give over when they pleaſe; So this Hypocrite is all for leading, till he think fit to give over, provided others will give him leave to keep to his owne pace, and not force him beyond it.</p>
                     <p>But, no greater trial of vertue, than in competition; not who ſhall ſooneſt take up, but who ſhall excel in going furtheſt. He that knows the goodneſſe of a blade will bend it to the hilts; but he that doubts of the mettle, thinks he hath done very much to bend it half way. He that takes up a race after goodneſſe, and immediately lets fall the perſuit, Saying, <hi>ſuch and ſuch had need to be better than I, yet have ſcarce gone ſo farre,</hi> is of a baſe and ignoble ſpirit; farre unlike that of <hi>Nehemiah</hi>

                     <p>This hypocrite when he ſees others go beyond him, in ſtead of emulating, he envieth at them; and, in ſtead of treading on their heels, carpeth at their ſteps. If you point him to a <hi>Saul,</hi> that after he became a <hi>Paul,</hi> made more haſte; he bids you look on a <hi>Gamaliel</hi>

If you ſhew him any that have out ſtript him, he bids you to look back to <hi>Zaccheus, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and other <hi>Publicans and harlots,</hi> that were farre behind him. And yet, even in theſe, he is deceived, becauſe he looks only on the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of their ſinful courſes coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, but obſerves not how by repentance they have in the body and ſubſtance of grace gotten far before him. There is no man worſe then he that thinks himſelf good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe he is not the worſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But, ſaith he, ſee you not that many dear Saints of God have done as ill; yea, worſe then ever did I? <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>drunken: Lot</hi> added inceſt to drunkenneſſe; <hi>David</hi> fell into murder and adultery; <hi>Peter</hi> into apoſtacy, &amp;c. Why then find you ſuch great fault with me who was never ſo bad? You dare not deny them to be godly, or, to be now in heaven; Why then muſt I be thought not godly enough, becauſe ſome of the godly be better, while many of them be worſe?</q> Thus, he abuſeth unto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, what is recorded for caution; and, of warnings to avoid ſin, he maketh war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to commit it; In ſtead of ſtriving to be like them in grace and repentance, he pleaſeth himſelf that they were like him, nay, worſe then he in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>But even here alſo he puts another cheat upon himſelf; for, never any of them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſo high a nature, as to ground a liberty to themſelves upon other mens infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or to gather a toleration from that which God intended for admonition, that he <hi>that thinketh he ſtandeth, might take the more heed leaſt he fall</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He remembers <hi>the exhortation that ſpeaks to him</hi> and all Chriſtians, <hi>as unto children.

                        <hi>This Hypocrite is a great applauder of the golden mean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mediocrity carrieth a good name among men, becauſe it hath a ſhadow and ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of vertue, if not miſtaken. Herewith this Hypocrite (who is apt to miſtake all things) deceiveth others, and moſt of all himſelf. For mark what he meaneth by his <hi>golden mean:</hi> not a <hi>mean</hi> between two evils in the extreams, (as between <hi>exceſſe and defects</hi> in the ſame quality, which is the only good and vertuous <hi>mean;</hi>) but, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mean between <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in the <hi>degrees</hi> only; as <hi>Lukewarme</hi> in <hi>zeal,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what covetous, partly proud, meetly profane: Or, between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> as halfe good, <hi>almoſt a Chriſtian:</hi> or, between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> as, <hi>indifferent,</hi> neither good nor bad, neither <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> nor <hi>Papiſt.</hi> So that the hypocrites <hi>mean,</hi> is, <hi>not to be over good, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly bad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Somewhat he would faine do, that he may not be accounted profane; but, not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, leſt he be thought too preciſe. He commends the <hi>mean,</hi> but never knew what it meant. If he can do ſomething for God that croſſeth not his luſts, this is his <hi>mean;</hi> if God require more, that is too much. His luſts command him, they therefore muſt be the rule of his <hi>mediocrity,</hi> although the Word ſhall have the name of giving that rule and name to his practiſe; when yet none of the kindred of godlineſs <hi>was ever called by that name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Scripture warneth men not to be <hi>over juſt,</hi> or <hi>over wiſe</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Eccleſ 7.16.</note>, he thinks it ſpeaks for him: not conſidering, that the Holy Ghoſt, to ſpeak to our underſtandings, is faine to borrow our words; and, to call things, as we (although ſometimes perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) ſtile them. But, the true meaning of God, is this: that, whereas we account <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> juſtice in extreamity; (which admits of no qualification, or regard to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or charity,) to be <hi>in juſtice,</hi> the Lord forbids this exceſſe of <hi>juſtice;</hi> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men count him to be <hi>over wiſe,</hi> who preſumes to be wiſer than all men, or than himſelf indeed is; and, to know more than all; when perhaps, <hi>he knows nothing as he ought to know;</hi> the Lord condemneth this proud conceit, under the name of <hi>over much wiſdome:</hi> whereas, of true <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> there can never be too much.</p>
                     <p>But, this hypocrite would have goodneſſe in ſo remiſſe a degree, that his evil might not be driven wholly out of doores. He would have <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> (things in compatible) both houſe together; a little religion for Sundayes, and ſome ſinne for week dayes, need not (as he thinks) to part company.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63232:94"/> He would profeſſe grace, and expect glory, yet have a little liberty for ſome ſinne, which he hopes will do no great harm for him to live in, and it to live in him. An <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> which is to Chriſt, as <hi>Lukewarme-water</hi> that procureth <hi>vomit</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 3.16.</note>, for want of ſome exuberant quality to affect the ſtomack, and to put it upon ſome other work.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>The true Chriſtian expatiateth in the true holie Mean.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is for a <hi>mean,</hi> not between <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> ſo as to participate ſomewhat of either, as <hi>Agrippa</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 26.28, 29.</note>: nor, between the <hi>leaſt good,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt pitch of goodneſſe,</hi> ſo as to ſtand ſtill in the way to perfection<note n="p" place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note>; but, he is for the <hi>mean</hi> between <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> in oppoſite extreams.

                     <p>This <hi>mean</hi> hath a long latitude: yet, that ſaying <hi>Ne quid nimis</hi> (beware of any thing too much) hath here no place.

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 5.47.</note>, a kind of <hi>redundancy</hi> beyond the common <hi>ſtandard,</hi> as well as <hi>practiſe;</hi> which haply, the world counts <hi>ſingularity,</hi> if not madneſſe; and preferres the Hypocrites <hi>meane</hi> (who is no medler, nor eye-ſore by his over-forwardneſſe) to this <hi>over-doing,</hi> as the world accounts it.</p>
                     <p>But, the judgment of the world in the things of God is not to be regarded, nor will be taken for the true Chriſtians bounds in duty. Unto the right conſtitution of a Chriſtian, which is ſanctification, belongs an holy exceſs<note n="r" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.18</note>, (although not of <hi>wine,</hi> which he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; but, of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> wherein his ſoul delighteth) wherby he is carried above the ſphere, of not only the <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> but he <hi>rules</hi> alſo of carnal men.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as one that would needs ſaile in ſight of both <hi>Poles</hi> (which is impoſſible) but approacheth neither; the true Chriſtian makes Chriſt his <hi>Cynoſure</hi> and Steeres-man, and ſo goeth <hi>elevating</hi> more and more the Pole of <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſaileth</hi> further and further from that of <hi>evil:</hi> the one would keep a <hi>mean</hi> that may hold him in from being too <hi>bad;</hi> the other is for the <hi>mean,</hi> that will make him more <hi>good.</hi>

God keep me, as I am; (ſaith he) and grant I be no worſe, and then no fear. He is not now to learn his duty, nor to begin to ſerve God. If others go further, he looks on it as their folly, and pride.

At the publick prayers none more zealous, devout and reverent; at a <hi>Sermon</hi> none more remiſſe, careleſſe and irreverent. He will have prayers once a day in the family, and that going to bed, becauſe he may die before he get up again, but, he hath haſte of work in the morning. Or, ſay he come twice to family duty, that muſt excuſe him for the cloſet. He will not exceed that upon any occaſion.

He cuts out the Lord hard penny-worths of ſervice. Sure there is more hope of a <hi>Publican,</hi> than of ſuch a <hi>Phariſee.</hi> Not that all <hi>formes</hi> are in all perſons, alwayes to be blamed: but, that to tie
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63232:95"/> devotion on all occaſions, to a forme or pittance, is the killing of affection the life and ſoul of Religion.</p>
                     <p>He that is as good as he means to be, will never be ſo good as he ſhould be. He that ties himſelf to an Ordinary, which he will in no caſe exceed, even his Ordinary is of hypocriſie; and, in caſes extraordinary, he muſt needs be as far to ſeek, as the <hi>Virgins</hi> that had their Oyle to buy, when they were to <hi>uſe it</hi>

It is not out of the perfection of due ſtature that men are paſt growing in grace; but, of ill conſtitution, yea, out of want of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of ſpiritual life. Such ſtarvlings ſhame the Lords Houſe-keeping in theſe dayes of plenty of good proviſion. Many in times of famine (in compariſon) have been more fat and in better liking; But theſe, coming up; as <hi>Pharaohs lean Kine,</hi> and <hi>starved eares,</hi> having <hi>eaten</hi> up the former and fatter, and yet continue <hi>leane</hi> and ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is never ſo good as he would be, or as he endeavours to be. On all occaſions he reneweth his repentance, and his vow of new obedience. His ſorrow is that he is not ſuch as he ſhould be: but he ſomewhat comforts himſelf with this, that he is ſo farre from being contented with being as he is, as he is from being what he ought. Therefore he reinforceth his care, winds up the ſtrings of his heart that are apt to ſlacken and to put all out of tune, and doubles his diligence to be and do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth that what is but ordinary will quickly faile, if it be not now and then helped with extraordinary; as wines that feed upon themſelves, if there be nothing elſe to feed them. <hi>Be awake, or watchful</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and strengthen the things which remaine, and are ready to die.</hi> Therefore the Chriſtian often looketh back to his principles, and to the vow of Baptiſme; and, wherein he finds himſelf impaired, he mourneth, and haſtneth to recover: wherein he thrives and growes, he is more carefull to manure and dreſſe his heart better, that it may yet grow more. For, he conſiders that where God hath planted and ſowed, he looks for not only fruit, but <hi>much fruit;</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">John. 15.8.</note> and, where he ſeeth ſome, he calleth for more; and, that God would have all to be on the amending thriving hand; the evil, that they may be good; the good, that they may be better. And where God is pleaſed to bleſs, he cauſeth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> in <hi>Gerar</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the Chriſtian, how good ſoever he be, never repeats it, never reſteth in it; nor looks upon his goodneſſe as being enough; but, to find out his wants of more. He is a Chriſtian in good earneſt, that goes ſo far from evil, till he be paſt knowledge, or thought of returning. He is alwayes diſpleaſed with what he is, that he may be the more quickned to aſpire to what he wanteth. He is ever waking, ever walking, afraid to ſtand ſtill, for feare of taking cold; <hi>holding on his way,</hi> and growing <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus this Hypocrite is like the good fellow in a journey, that finding good fare and liquor in an Inne, takes up his reſt there, and never goes further; the Chriſtian is a true traveller that goes ſtill on, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> till he arive at <hi>Zion:</hi> the one is as <hi>Zacheus</hi> that (being <hi>little of ſtature,</hi> yet, at his full growth) <hi>climbed a tree to ſee Chriſt</hi>

                     <p>There, he puts on the bridle; here, he claps to the ſpurre. Indeed every one that ſtints grace, gives the reignes to his luſt, and liberty to ſinne; and therefore ſets bounds to goodneſſe, that corruption may have the more ſcope. He committeth <hi>Zeal</hi> to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for a very ſmall offence; nay, perhaps, for doing but her duty, and make <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe</hi> her keeper, which he knows to be her mortall enemy. But, as rank fences take up too much of the ground which would yield better fruit; ſo profane limitation and reſtriction laid upon himſelf in good things, take up, and eats out the heart of the field of goodneſs: for, from ſuch hedges, the briars of vice ſpread over the whole inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>His pittance of Religion will never do him good, while he ſtints himſelf to that pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is with him in this, as with other men in other things. We ſee ſuch as have but a little skill in phyſick, to be for the moſt part ill at eaſe; a ſmattering in Law, and ever wrangling, three letres in learning and ever cavelling; a little conſcience, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtretching it; a little knowledge, and ever wavering; ſo, a little goodneſſe, and ever ſinning. Religion ſtinted, is as the Sunne-beames in <hi>March;</hi> pleaſing, becauſe the dayes be longer; yet hurtfull, becauſe they ſtir humours, which they are not able to reſolve, and ſo, occaſion diſeaſes, which may prove the death of the party.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary. <hi>The true Chriſtian ſets bounds upon evil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>that he may be unbounded in good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not that he would not utterly root out all the Philiſtins in <hi>Canaan,</hi> if he could: but when he cannot do that, he pens them in as narrow a corner as he is able, although ſome <hi>Amalekites</hi> remain, he hath yet <hi>warre with Amaleck to all generations,</hi> and kills as many of them as he is able, not ſparing ſo much as <hi>Agag</hi> their King: but till he can do this, he will be ſure to coop them up in as ſmall a room as is poſſible, and to make the borders and rampiers ſtrong to prevent invaſion, that he may more quietly follow his own buſineſſe and occaſions. What luſts he cannot put to the ſword, he will caſt into priſon, and lay on them the ſtrongeſt fetters he hath, or can procure; and if they be unruly, they ſhall <hi>feel his fingers,</hi> and his cudgel to<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note>. He will maſter them, if he cannot deſtroy them; he will keep them in the dungeon, till he bring them out to execution. He will not allow them (as the Hypocrite doth) the liberty of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but puts bolts and fetters on hands and feet, and loads them with irons all the time they lie there.</p>
                     <p>As men that recover Land from the Sea, get every day as much as they can maintain, and ſo go on ſtill getting, making good fence againſt over-flowings of the water. So the Chriſtian recovers dayly ſome ground, although not all at once, from the dead Sea of ſinne that is in his corrupt nature. And ſo, although he that curbeth goodneſſe can never be good, yet he that gets and grows upon his corruptions, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting narrower and ſtronger bonds upon them, cannot but be good, and will be excellent. His bounds that he ſets upon evil, is not to keep it in, but to keep it out.</p>
                     <p>As the tree, by pruning is made leſſe rank, and more fruitful; ſo a Chriſtian, by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. He is like the <hi>Olive,</hi> the <hi>Figg-tree,</hi> the <hi>Vine</hi> in <hi>Jothams</hi> parable, which would not <hi>leave their fruitfulneſſe to rule over the trees</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Judges 9.</note>; he will not leave his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for all the power, pleaſure, honour, wealth in the world, or to be ſole monarch of the world. He rejecteth all that might ſet barres to his goodneſs, or block up his grace.</p>
                     <p>He had rather the Lord ſhould prune him, and lay bare his root by ſeaſonable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63232:96"/> than that any wilde-ſhootes ſhould ſtarve or diminiſh in him the fruits of holineſſe. He transferreth to heavenly things the exceſſe of earthly affections. There, he will <hi>love,</hi> even <hi>inſanato animo,</hi> as one (ſeeming to others who know not how to judge aright) to be <hi>beſide himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.13.</note>; and, it becometh him well, towards Chriſt. There, he will be as <hi>ambitious</hi> as <hi>Haman,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> or <hi>Dictrephes;</hi> but, for ſpiritual favour, and preferment. There, he will be as <hi>covetous</hi> as <hi>Nabal</hi> to gather and hoard up; and will lay out nothing but for advantage, that he may be ſure to find it in heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite in <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> is as one that wadeth; fearful to ſtep forward, leſt he ſhould go paſt his depth; but the Chriſtian is as he that ſwimmeth, or ſaileth; the deeper, the better, and leſſe feare of ſplitting, or drowning; the one in <hi>evil,</hi> launceth into the maine, as accounting himſelf in beſt caſe when he hath moſt ſea-room; the other dares not venture into the deep, but ſcrambles along by the banks till he can get to land. The one checketh goodneſſe, that he may have his full careir in ſinne, the other curbeth ſinne, that he may have a more full courſe in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</p>

                     <p>He muſt have ſome liberty. He will ſinne; but, within compaſſe. He will rob the Lord, but caſt him ſomewhat back again, as theeves to a traveller. If he do borrow of God, as high-way men uſe, <hi>judgement, mercy, and faith;</hi> he will be ſo kind as to leave him <hi>tithes;</hi> not, of <hi>corn</hi> (that were too much) but of <hi>mint, annis, and cummin</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note>: and he muſt account himſelf well dealt with too, that he allowes him the leſſer, when he ſweeps away the greater; and, payes him <hi>mint,</hi> when he cannot ſpare him <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He imagineth he can pitch ſome bounds in evil, beyond which he will not paſſe: and upon that account, adventures on the evil: but, before he is aware, he exceeds his limits, and his intentions, and leaps deeper into the mire of ſin than ever he meant; as <hi>Judah</hi> that intending no more but to give way to his luſt to commit ſimple fornication, fell over head and eares into <hi>inceſt</hi> with his own daughter-in-Law<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 38.18.</note>. Satan is too cunning for him; as <hi>Tamar,</hi> he diſguiſeth not only himſelf, but the ſin: and ſo while the Hypocrite <hi>flatters himſelf in his own eyes,</hi> that he will go no further in ſin, than at firſt he propounds to himſelf, nor meddle with any ſin, but ſuch as at preſent ſeemes to him to be no great matter; he ſuffers himſelf to be ſo long, and ſo far hoodwinkt by this flattery, <hi>that his iniquity is found to be hateful;</hi> not only as all ſin is, to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but, as the groſſeſt ſinnes are to the moral and civil men of the world. His ſinne hath couſened him, not only in the degrees of ſinning beyond what he propounded; but in the very <hi>kinde,</hi> and <hi>circumſtances,</hi> which he never dream't of.</p>
                     <p>He ſometimes ſeems to draw blood of ſin, when it grows too rank for a man of his rank and profeſſion: but, as a Chirurgion not as an executioner: he ſtops the vaine, before there be any danger of life to the ſin. Thus, under the colour of forbearing groſſer ſins he intireth himſelf to other ſins without feeling or ſtartling; as men by degrees frame themſelves to an ill aire, till it become ſo natural, that it now fits their conſtitution better than a purer, which would ſooner make them ſick, than the worſt: or, as ſome ſo long accuſtome themſelves to phyſick, yea to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it no longer works upon them, nor can they be well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrarily, <hi>The True Chriſtian deſires to be totally rid of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He would not willingly give the water any paſſage, no not a little. Sin is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſpawn, and very like the parent, the ſerpent hath a ſubtile head, but very little. If therefore ſin by ſubtilty but once thruſt in her little head, it is ſcarce all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans skill that can keep out her whole body: which the Chriſtian knowing, will kill that at firſt ſight of ſin, which he could not cruſh in the egge of his luſt within him: he will <hi>ſhake off this viper</hi> ſo ſoon as ever it catcheth hold of his hand, leſt otherwiſe he ſoon beomea dead man if it once get into his heart.</p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:63232:96"/>
                     <p>Evil is a weed that he would fain root up, that it might not at all grow in the meaneſt plat of his garden; no not in the baſeſt part of his baſeſt court. In the mean time he keeps it down as much as he can, and ſpits up as much of the root as he is able, that it may never ſeed, or flower. He is of opinion that he that hath a mind to taſte a little of <hi>madneſſe and folly,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> did<note n="k" place="margin">Eccleſ 1.17</note>, cannot point how far and no further, he will be <hi>fooliſh</hi> or frantick. Therefore he ſets not termes to folly, within which, if it keep, he will be content; but ſets himſelf wholly to exterminate it; His <hi>ſtinting,</hi> is his endeavour to deſtroy it, not to cheriſh or permit it to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                     <p>Neither <hi>ſin</hi> nor <hi>grace</hi> can endure to be ſtinted; the one muſt be killed out right, or it will ſoon grow exorbitant; the other if <hi>ſtinted,</hi> is killed; therefore in the work of mortification, he ſpares not the throat or heart blood of any luſt, that he can come at, nor will it ſuffice him to naile it to the Croſſe, unleſſe he alſo bury it with Chriſt, and be ſure it be left there, with his <hi>grave-cloaths,</hi> without hope of a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Thus this Hypocrite by ſtinting ſin that it may be little, makes it much, as by ſtinting grace, of little, he makes it none; the true Chriſtian by mortifying ſin in ſtead of ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of great, makes ſin little, till it ceaſe to be; the one treats with ſin as borderers about their confines; the other makes war upon ſin in good earneſt, even within her owne borders. The one playes the Chirurgeon with ſin to open a vein, to give it a breathing, by which it becomes ſtronger; the other, as the Prieſt, doth kill and ſlay it, letting out the very <hi>life</hi> with the <hi>blood,</hi> if he once come ſo near as to lay his <hi>hand</hi> upon the head of that unruly heifer.</p>

One vice entertained diſſolves the whole fabrick and chaine of graces; as one grace neglected makes every vice too hard for the reſt. Neither vertue nor vice conſiſts all of one link; and, albeit vices, cut and mangled never ſo much, make work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for grace; yet graces ſevered, are over-matcht by vice. There is a circle and concatenation of graces, and a conſpiracy of vices; ſo that he that will have any grace muſt have all, or none: but he that will have any vice, ſhall be ſure to have all, although he begin but with one.</p>
                     <p>No one vertue makes a vertuous man, no more than all can ſave him: yet one vice alone, allowed, will deſtroy him; as, the leaſt aberration in letting ſlip the arrow makes a wide errour at the mark <hi>Benefacta benefactis pertegito, &amp;c.</hi> Vertues muſt be laid like tiles, one over-lapping another, to keep out all rain of corruption.

                     <p>There is great difference betwixt the ſweat of the earth, which is the dew, and the dew of heaven, which is the rain. For the one makes the earth more ready to ſcorch, the other watereth the earth, and maketh it fruitful. The oddes is no leſſe between this Hypocrite and the true Chriſtian. Whatever dew of goodneſſe ſeems to lie thick upon the Hypocrite, it hath only earth for its original, and ſo cannot make any thing to grow which ſeems to be wet with this dew.

                     <p>Many things without life waxing greater, ſeem to grow, by an accretion or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of like things from without, as ſtones, and clouds, as well as the ſnow-ball: So this Hypocrite living under the Meridian of Ordinances and godly Chriſtians, coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, catching here a piece, and there a piece, by hearing, faſhion, example, and imitation; and ſo ſomething or other ſtill hangeth on, and cleaveth to him, like moiſt ſand to a wheele going upon it, that makes the wheele ſeem bigger in the ſpoaks and vellews, then indeed it is. And ſo the Hypocrite grows bigger in ſome phraſes, geſtures, outward garb and motions of a true Chriſtian, but without any augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from life and heat of grace within; And ſo, all his growth is but like a thick coat of morter laid upon a wall; He waxeth, but he groweth not: there is an augmentation ſuch as it is, but not by vegetation from an inward principle of life that firſt operates within, and then makes the augmentation to be in the whole body, not in the clothes with which the body is covered. And ſo, when he ſpeaks religiouſly, it is but as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63232:100"/> uſing the voice of a man; but, without the mind and intellect: when he moves to or to any ſpiritual duty, it is like an Ape imitating reaſonable actions without reaſon to guide him in them.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian hath his nouriſhment without,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>His nouriſhment comes as from the market; but as meat is firſt taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and afterwards nouriſheth the parts within, and then ſendeth it ſelf forth again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the outward members; ſo the Chriſtian, from <hi>the word</hi> taken in as <hi>Milke</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note>, receives nouriſhment from without, which operates firſt within, after he hath <hi>hid the word in his heart</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 119.11.</note>; and then, from the heart, he begins to ſpread and encreaſe more and more outwardly, till it bud forth (as ſap from the root, through the bark of a tree) and ſhew it ſelf in the outward man, and in his whole converſation alſo.</p>
                     <p>He putteth on Religion, not only, or firſt, as an outward garment to cover him; or, for faſhion; but, as his skinne which is firſt formed and perfected by grace from the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of life within, and thence it receives all the lovelineſſe and beauty that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appears in it. He firſt growes within, and then without. He is as the ſilk-worm, that ſpins her coat out of her own bowels, after ſhe hath received all her alterations and growth from an inward encreaſe. He is firſt engraffed into Chriſt; then, from Chriſt, the heart drawes ſo much nouriſhment, as thereby <hi>Chriſt is formed in him,</hi> that is, within him (as the ſeed by natural heat and warmth comes to be faſhioned into mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and into a body like the parent); and ſo, from hence it is that he groweth, and bringeth forth in the life, not only the leaves of profeſſion, but the fruits of obedience unto God<note n="o" place="margin">John. 15.5.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Hercules</hi> in a ſuit of <hi>hangings;</hi> in one piece a little childe, in another, a grown man; the other as <hi>Hercules living,</hi> that from an infant grew to that ſtrength and proweſſe as to be able to encounter and maſter the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Gyant, the felleſt creatures; the one is as a Basket in the Market, full of fruit which never grew there; the other, as a tree in the Orchard, that bare thoſe fruits, and many more.</p>

                     <p>His growth is rather like that of the haire and nailes which nature puts out as excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the skin and outward parts, and as purgaments of the body, of which nature deſires to unburden her ſelf, and which grow even when a man is dead, ſo long as there is any moiſture left to feed them.

There may be an extuberation of knowledge, ſome flaſhings and flaſhes of an unkindly zeal, ſome violent affections, rather than well-guided motions; all which are but as kernels in the body, no kindly fleſh; as a <hi>mola</hi> or timpany of pride or affection, proceeding from rankneſſe of heart, <hi>being vainly put up of his fleſhly mind</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Col. 2.18.</note> which is diametrally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Apoſtle to the encreaſe of the members of the body of Chriſt, <hi>from whom they have nouriſhment miniſtred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, although this Hypocrite may have ſome accretions of knowledge, zeal, and of ſome external formalities, yet they are all but as wens in the body, or as exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances in the blood, ſeek vent by the pores.

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Rev. 3.1.</note>, even as <hi>ſhe that liveth in pleaſure</hi> (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion, and making ſhew of ordinary zeal) <hi>is dead while ſhe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                     <p>His encreaſe is kindly, and it is from nouriſhment received from his head, which diffuſeth it ſelf to the whole man, and makes him to grow in ſolid grace not in exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of wit; in his limbs and ſtrength, not in ſwellings of heart, nor in external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63232:101"/> and formalities, which, were ever found alone, are no better then excrements. Whatever grows, whatever ſhews of growth appear in him, proceeds not from the excreſcency of corruption, but from <hi>the godly nature</hi>

This is our hypocrites caſe; He is very forward; ſoon ripe, I mean, at his beſt: yet even then, is far ſhort of being good: inſomuch as he is as the early ſpring, the haſty fruit which are grown into a by-word for their ominous and commonly unprofitable forwardneſſe.

                     <p>A falſe perfideous heart that devoureth the hope of goodneſſe, uſually lies at the bottome of a more than ordinarily forward beginning; when theſe like a worm at the root of a <hi>gourd;</hi> ſo that man is ſo ſwift as hardly any man can keep pace with him, he will not long be able to hold pace with himſelf, for that he ſoon out-runs his own breath and power; and ſo ſits down in the mid-way, and never comes to the end of his race.</p>
                     <p>All violent motions are ſo ſwift at firſt, that 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be perpetual. Such is the motion of this hypocrite, who for a while ſeems to <hi>run well</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 5.7.</note>, but it is but for a ſpurt.

                     <p>And no marvel.

He will not attempt profeſſion of Religion, but when Religion is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and thoſe by whom he ſeeks to riſe, are very religious, or at leaſt ſeem to be. And as for all other corruptions within him, he is at truce with them, untill he hath either attained his ends, or is wholly croſt in them. Nor will Satan oppoſe, while he finds him at work upon no better foundation, but rather help him to be more cunning and active, untill he ſee his time to turn him quite off from the way of godlineſs, which in the iſſue he is ſure to do.</p>

He is big and ſwells in knowledge, but little in conſcience; inſomuch as it is a wonder, in ſuch a plentiful harveſt of knowledge, to find ſuch poor gleanings of conſcience and true piety. He is all in a flame in zeal, but little in diſcretion; much in wiſdome in his own opinion, but little in love. Yea, one part ſtarves another. A bunch of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> on the back, makes but a ſpindle-ſhank-<hi>zeal</hi> in the heart. As in the body the ſpleenes increaſe is the pining of the body.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note>. Here is a general growth, no miſ-matching; all parts hold proportion one with another.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that ſome graces have, in ſeveral believers, been more eminent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous: as <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Abraham; zeal</hi> in <hi>David; Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt in <hi>Paul:</hi> yet, as it fals out in the parts of the body, ſome man may have a ſtronger arme, another a better leg, a third a ſweeter face; or ſome one other part that may more affect the beholder; yet, all comely, and holding a good ſymetry and proportion; ſo is it among Chriſtians in the endowments of the ſoule; Some may excel more in one grace, ſome in another; yet not ſo, as one grace in the ſame ſubject is alone, or hindereth the growth of another, or to render any unſerviceable, or diſproportionable to the reſt. There may indeed be ſome obſtruction in ſome part of the ſoule, and of ſome particular grace in it, that it thrives not equally as ſome other graces do; but yet there is life and ſome growth, even in that very part, and in time the obſtruction will be removed by him who is <hi>able to make all grace abound in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No body, how perfect ſoever, is wholly free from ſome diſtemper or obſtruction in ſome parts of it, nor any ſoul ſo exempt from all diſcracy and diſorder, but that ſome graces may be obſtructed in their growth, ſo as, his humility, patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, or ſuch like, do not hold pace with his faith, zeal, and love. An ague may hinder the growth of a child for a while, ſo may ſome remaines of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption hinder the growth of a Chriſtian, which being more maſtered and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, proves a meanes of greater and firmer growth afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite in his greateſt growth, is but a monſter in grace; the true Chriſtian, in his greateſt obſtructions hath all the parts of the new creature propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; the one, grows in ſome particular with neglect of the reſt; the other growes up in all things, applying moſt care, coſt, and paines upon any particular that thriveth leaſt.</p>

                     <p>The true Chriſtian is as covetous in ſpirituals, as any earth-worm in carnals. <hi>He coveteth earneſtly the beſt gifts</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note>, and is never ſatisfied. He thinks he hath gotten nothing, while any thing more may be had: as <hi>Paul,</hi> he <hi>forgets</hi> whatever <hi>is behind</hi> him, which he hath in poſſeſſion, out of his covetous deſire to reach thoſe things which he <hi>hath not already attained,</hi> that he may at length hit the very mark it ſelf<note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 3.12, 13, 14.</note>, which is every mans aime, but few mens attainment. He had rather be cut down by death, than not thrive continually. He is as a thriving tree, not a dead poſt, or ſtake, as a quick-ſet, not a dead hedge. His talent is in the bank, not in the bagge. He will not pinch his conſcience, to make it ſmall in the waſte, as they that affect handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more then health; but ſtrives to have <hi>animam athleticam,</hi> a ſoul well-ſpread, and well-grown, able to try with all comers, and to be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord,</hi> to <hi>wreſtle with</hi> the greateſt <hi>principalities, and powers,</hi> even the greateſt Devils with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or without him, that ſhall encounter or obſtruct his growth in grace.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as a young tree in a Coppiſſe, or wood grub'd up, which thrives not, even when the nouriſhment of all the earth neere it is afforded to it; the true Chriſtian, as the <hi>Cammomel,</hi> which ſtill thriveth, even while moſt trodden upon to keep it down; the one is as a man in an hectick feaver, that although ſometimes he ſeems ruddy and freſh, yet daily pineth away, under beſt means of cure, and moſt nouriſhing gellies; the other is as <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes, that with <hi>pulſe</hi> and <hi>water waxed ſairer and fatter</hi>

                        <hi>This Hypocrites growth is all out of emulation.</hi>

                     <p>He ſeeks not ſo much to grow, as to out-grow others whom out of envy he emulates like the <hi>Toad</hi> in the fable, that would needs ſwell as big as the Oxe, envy putting him upon the hazzard of the burſting of his skin, without the leaſt bettering of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It grieves him not that himſelf is defective in grace, but it vexeth him at heart to be matched by the common ſort, and to be over-matched by thoſe of the beſt rank. If he ſee others go before him, this diſpleaſeth him, not out of ſorrow that himſelf wants grace, but that he comes behinde others, whom he envies for having more.</p>
                     <p>Were he to go alone, he cares not how ſlowly he goeth; but, when company calls on him to mend his pace, this troubles him that they out-go him, and that he is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Not love to grace, but a ſpirit of envy maketh him to advance; as ſelf-guiltineſſe cauſeth him to envy.

                     <p>He looks upon the graces of God in others as patterns for imitation, as glorifying God for them: not as matter of envy and emulation to out-go them for his own praiſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for doing ſervice to God. He propounds for his patterns not thoſe that come ſhort of him, that ſo he might rejoyce and think well of himſelf; but, thoſe that go furtheſt beyond him, that he may the more ſhame his owne negligence, and the more provoke his diligence to make the more haſte after them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite groweth (like <hi>Apuleius</hi> his <hi>Cupid</hi>) in meer ſpite and competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for vain-glory; the true Chriſtian groweth out of love to goodneſſe, and duty to God, in bringing in more glory to his Name; the one would never care to be ſo good, if others were worſe; the other ſeeks ſtill to be better, though others come behind him in goodneſs.</p>

                     <p>Thus, the hypocrite is as light eares, that perke up above heavier corn; the Chriſtian rather hangeth the head, as the well grown eare: the one inwardly pineth as a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tree at the heart, while he ſeems to flouriſh without; the other ſtill groweth to moſt profit to the owner, even when he ſeemes to be bark-bound, and to ſtand at a ſtay in outward appearance; the one ſwelleth, the other truly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Deale not here with the <hi>Temporizer,</hi> who takes up only a <hi>ſhew</hi> of Religion (knowing himſelf to be a counterfeit) meerly to ſerve the time, and himſelf of it; but, with him that ſeems to himſelf, as well as in the opinion of others, to take up Religion and goodneſſe really, and in good earneſt, at the preſent; but, not into <hi>an honest and good heart,</hi> and ſo abides in it but for a time.</p>
                     <p>This is he that of all others will give us moſt matter, and moſt labour, ſhould we trace him to the end of all his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings; for, how ſhall we do to know and diſcover him to the bottome, that knows not himſelf?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temporizer</hi> indeed deceiveth others, mocketh the Church, and collogneth with the world; yet, knoweth his own meaning and intent well enough, as <hi>Judas</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt for the bag and bagage, being a <hi>thief,</hi> a <hi>traitor,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> from the beginning. Such another alſo was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who when he ſaw it was no boot to ſtrive in the open habit and profeſſion of a Sorcerer, becauſe men, formerly great admirers and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him, daily fell from him to <hi>Philip,</hi> when they <hi>heard and ſaw the miracles which Philip did</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 8.6.</note>; by which, the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> cryed down his deluſions: he then betook himſelf to this Stratagem, to profeſſe beliefe in Chriſt; and, being <hi>baptized, continued with Philip,</hi> making great ſhew of <hi>wondring</hi> at him, <hi>beholding the miracles and ſignes which were done</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 13.</note>: in all which notwithſtanding, he onely lay in the winde for advantage, hoping to make a better market of his new faith, than (as things now ſtood) could be expected from his old <hi>ſorcery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:63232:105"/>
                     <p>But this our <hi>Temporary</hi> is the great deceiver of the world, of the Church, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: for, when he thinks to put tricks upon <hi>his own heart</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">James 1.26</note>, his heart, being the more cunning Jugler, <hi>deceiveth himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> moſt. He not only deceiveth others in ſhew, but himſelf in conceit. For, for any thing he knows or perceives, he is in good earneſt, and means in good faith. For, he becomes not only like, but equal, yea ſuperiour to the true Chriſtian in his own opinion, in his beginnings of profeſſion of grace and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the difference lyes only in <hi>the honeſt and good heart</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 8.15.</note>, <hi>receiving the Word,</hi> and <hi>cleaving to the Lord with purpoſe of heart</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 11.23.</note>, without ſeparation, or backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>Yet, becauſe theſe two hypocrites, the <hi>Temporizer,</hi> and the <hi>Temporary,</hi> do often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeire one upon another, I muſt crave patience of Logical Readers, if I ſeem ſometimes to mingle <hi>Heterogenials,</hi> and to <hi>tautologize,</hi> ſpeaking things of the one that agree to the other, and then come over ſome of the ſame things again, in ſpeaking of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Our greateſt buſineſſe with the <hi>Temporary,</hi> is, to turn his inſide outward, and to lay open his heart: where, if any ſhall move that queſtion of the Prophet; <hi>the heart</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note>? Thanks be to God who maketh this anſwer, (by which we may be guided in this enterpriſe), <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reines</hi>

And thanks to our bleſſed Saviour, who as he <hi>knew them,</hi> that knew not themſelves<note n="i" place="margin">John 2.24.</note>; he hath left us ſome direction how to find out this ſelf-deceiving hypocrite, whom he deſcribeth under the Parable of the <hi>stony ground</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 13.5, 6.</note>, wherein there is <hi>ſome earth,</hi> but more <hi>stone</hi> and <hi>rock</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 8.6.</note>; Some <hi>earth</hi> it had, but not enough: <hi>no deepneſſe of earth</hi> to give nouriſhment to the <hi>ſeed</hi> ſown in it and to preſerve it from <hi>withering.</hi> This <hi>ſtony ground</hi> he deſcribeth two wayes; firſt, by the <hi>ingreſſe,</hi> and <hi>progreſſe;</hi> then, by the baſe <hi>regreſſe</hi> of this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, upon <hi>ſowing the ſeed of the Word,</hi> he <hi>with joy receiveth it</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 13.20.</note>, and <hi>immediately it ſprings up;</hi> not becauſe well-rooted; but, <hi>becauſe it hath no depth of earth</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Mar. 4.5.</note>. He is ſoon won, even before he conſidereth what that which he ſo haſtily embraceth, will coſt him: and, being ſo won to, and by the Word, the Word ſpringeth up in him with greater celerity than it uſeth to do in better ground, as graſſe on the houſe, or wall; which having the advantages of aire and Sunne, ſhootes up ſooner, than other graſſe in the richeſt ſoile.</p>
                     <p>He receiveth the Miniſters of the Word (eſpecially ſuch who are in greateſt eſteem) gladly and honourably, as <hi>Herod</hi> did the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Mar. 6.20.</note>; and, for a while, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 4.14.</note>, <hi>receiving him even as an Angel of God,</hi> yea even <hi>as Chriſt. Jeſus</hi> He condemneth of impiety thoſe that refuſe or neglect hearing. His heart is ſomewhat ſoftened, as <hi>Ahabs</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">1 King. 21.27, 29.</note>; but yet not <hi>opened</hi> to purpoſe, as <hi>Lydia's</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Acts 16.14.</note>; nor <hi>enlarged,</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 119.32</note>. So that ſome root the Word taketh, but not enough. Chriſt is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the hatch, or door, perhaps to the Hall, (where all comers are entertained, and thereby ſome acquaintance is begun;) but, not to the cloſet, or <hi>Bed-Chamber</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Cant. 3.4.</note>, whereby there may be a nearer friendſhip contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our Lord deſcribeth him by his too haſty <hi>regreſs</hi> alſo, after all that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>ingreſſe,</hi> and <hi>progreſſe.</hi> He hath <hi>no root,</hi> no <hi>depth of earth,</hi> therefore no moiſture for continuance. He dureth but <hi>for a ſeaſon.</hi> The Winter nips him, the Sunne ſcorcheth him. When tribulation cometh becauſe of the Word, he is <hi>by and by offended,</hi> and angry with himſelf that he engaged ſo far. He goeth away, as corn parched, or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. If the ſummer be not too hot, he may perhaps make a ſhift for a while: but if once the heat ſcorch him, he is like <hi>Jonahs</hi> gourd, that can hold up no longer. While the peace of the Goſpel laſteth, this Hypocrite holds up his head; who, higher? But, if that be withdrawn, this <hi>greene Bay tree paſſeth away, and loe he is not, and cannot be found</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 37.35, 36</note> in his former ſtation and rank.</p>
                     <p>In the general, he entertaineth <hi>Religion and Goodneſſe</hi> by whole ſale. He not onely layeth a true ground, or general propoſition, <hi>he that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but, hath
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63232:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> a part in the aſſumption, <hi>I alſo believe;</hi> which for ought he knoweth, he doth for a time; and hath, to his own thinkings, ſome beginnings of grace in him, and doth not intentionally and induſtriouſly counterfeit, as ſome others do, but ſeems to have ſome true ſeeds in him; but, not in a true heart, and therefore they never attain their true growth and perfection.</p>
                     <p>He entertaineth goodneſſe therefore for the time being, but not from a good heart. For, he caſteth not before hand what it will coſt him. He looks only at the preſent ſun-ſhine, without conſidering future ſtorms, or preparing for them. He knoweth not his own mind, but thinks to hold out, and will ſee no reaſon to the contrary. He hath <hi>meditata commodas,</hi> but not <hi>incommoda.</hi> He looks on what he may gain by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but not what he may loſe. He enters into his profeſſion, without fore-ſight or care of after-inconveniences. He layes a foundation of an houſe, not conſidering the coſt, and ſo leaves off building, as unable to <hi>finiſh it</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Luke 14.28.</note>. He engageth in a warfare, without <hi>ſitting down firſt, and conſulting whether he be able with ten thouſand to meet him that cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Verſe 31.</note>. He begins like a freſh-water-ſouldier and ends like a coward. He is a <hi>hot-ſpurre</hi> that tyres ere he come to the end of his journey, becauſe he neither conſidered the length of the way, nor the difficulties in it.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>The true Christian casteth up his coſts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>and perils afore hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knows and conſiders, that, to be truly religious, is a buſineſſe to which nature (as now corrupted) is not only a ſtranger, but an enemy, becauſe Religion is an enemy to the out-leaps of nature; and never gives over the purſuit of natures greateſt delights, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it hath <hi>taken them alive,</hi> and ſlaine them in the place where it took them, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did the ſonnes of <hi>Amaziah</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">2 King. 10.14</note>. He therefore caſteth before hand, how far he can engage in this quarrel, and what the iſſue may bee.</p>
                     <p>He well underſtandeth, that if he will walk fully after Chriſt, he muſt <hi>take up,</hi> and bear <hi>his Croſſe</hi> how heavy ſoever, <hi>and follow him</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 16.24.</note>, through thick and thinne, through fire and water: and that, not once or twice, but even <hi>daily</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note>; that he muſt not only <hi>forſake all to follow Christ</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 19.27.</note>; but even <hi>hate</hi> his neareſt and deareſt relations when they hate and oppoſe Chriſt: for, well he remembreth that ſaying of his Lord<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 14.26.</note>, <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters; yea, and his own life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Not to caſt off duty to natural relations wherein God binds him to honour them; but, ſo far to caſt off their commands as they command things contrary to Chriſt: and to hate them, as they ſeek to wrap him up in their ſins againſt Chriſt; ſin being hateful wherever it be found.</p>
                     <p>Yea, he takes more into his conſideration, than all this: for, he knows, he muſt not only deny all relations, and his own life, but even <hi>himſelf</hi> alſo in all his earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Wiſdome, Will, Hopes, Concernments, and Aimes, and whatever in the world is deereſt to him, which to a natural man, is more than life it ſelfe. He ſaith, even in things moſt deſired and prayed for, <hi>not my will, but thine be done.</hi> He had rather ſuffer any torture, than not deny himſelf for Chriſt, even when Chriſt ſeems moſt reſolute to put him upon the greateſt hardſhips, the ſharpeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</p>
                     <p>Every one makes a ſhift to hold on in Summer, while the peace of the Goſpel ſhineth in full ſtrength and brightneſſe; ſo long, the hypocrite will keep his rank and ſtation. But the Chriſtian keeps a good houſe in winter. He can keep a Sabbath, without a Sabbath, and erect a Sanctuary <hi>in the wilderneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 63.1, 2.</note>. <hi>Out of the depths,</hi> he can call and <hi>cry</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 130.1.</note> to his God, becauſe he wiſely conſidereth how low God can caſt him: and ſo, he is <hi>ſemper Idem,</hi> ever the ſame in the greateſt alterations, becauſe he fore-caſt all this, when he firſt reſolved to caſt himſelf wholly upon God and Chriſt. He entreth into Chriſtianity as into a Covenant of marriage ſeriouſly deliberated before entry into it; and therefore reſolves to forſake all, and to endure the worſt, rather than on his part to break that contract.</p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:63232:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite engageth before he conſidereth; and ſo, breaks his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe of the evils which he conſidered not: the true Chriſtian conſidereth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he engageth; and ſo, makes good his engagement maugre all the evils that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him: the one, by not caſting his coſts before hand, goes not through with his work; the other, goes on, becauſe he caſt up before he undertook the work, what it would coſt him.</p>

                        <hi>The Temporary takes Religion to farme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is willing to be dealing; but, he will firſt try a while, before he engage too farre. He will firſt take a leaſe for a time, before he bargaine for a free-hold during life. Not that he doth it out of deliberation as conſidering what it may coſt him: but, as having ſomewhat elſe in his eye which he cannot well compaſſe without adventuring for a while to take in this to farme, to drive on his other deſigne: and ſo, when after trial, be finds Religion either too hard a bargaine; or, that it will not contribute what he expected to his private ends, he gives it up againe. Therefore, when he findes his farme too hot, and his bargaine too hard, he layes the key un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the doore, goeth his way, and leaveth his Lord to go look his rent.</p>
                     <p>Religion is his farme, not his free-hold. He will be a Tenant at his own will, not at his Lords. He will hold it no longer then himſelf pleaſeth; and, throw up all when he liſteth. At preſent, having need of Religion, (not for the good of his ſoul, ſo much as for ſome preſent worldly advantage,) he muſt needs make uſe of it; and therefore, courteth and embraceth it with all the affection that a luſtful man endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe to her whom he would corrupt and abuſe. No marvel then, if when his luſt is ſerved, or croſſed, he throw off Religion, becauſe he either hath his ends by it, or is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely left in an impoſſibility of attaining them, or muſt give more for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of them, than Religion continued will (in his opinion) countervaile. No wonder therefore, if <hi>when perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, he be by and by offended;</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 13.21.</note> and, <hi>in time of ſuch temptation, fall away</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 8.13.</note>. <hi>The fiery trial ſeems a ſtrange thing</hi> unto him<note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.12.</note>. It is that he never looked for, much leſſe agreed for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the Contrary, <hi>The true Chriſtian takes Religion for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He conſidereth before hand that the benefit of it will abundantly recompence all the evils and inconveniences that attend it: and therefore ſtrikes a bargain for the <hi>fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as not only reſolved, but prepared to run all hazzards. He knows it to be a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain worth the purchaſing; he will therefore <hi>ſell all he hath to purchaſe it</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 13.46.</note>, let it coſt what it will. He reſolves with <hi>David</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. 119.11, 12.</note>, <hi>thy teſtimonies have I taken as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage forever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart: I have enclined mine heart to performe thy ſtatutes alwaies, even unto the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is his free-hold, his fee-ſimple; <hi>a purchaſe</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 3.18.</note> bought even of Chriſt himſelf, who hath a good title, and will not deceive the purchaſer; but, though he ſells dear in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of a carnal heart: yet, ſuch a penny worth, as he that truly knows the worth of it, will part with all that he hath for it, rather than go without it. The world may look on it as an hard bargain, but he knows it to be worth his money, and that he is made by it for ever; and, ſhould he let it go, he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the true Chriſtian had not this in his eye from the beginning. Poſſibly, at firſt, he might not look ſo far into the bargain. But afterwards, as ſome Farmers thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, at length prove purchaſers, and become Free-holders; ſo he, who, at his firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of Religion, ſeemed to differ little from the Temporary, proves afterwards a ſincere and ſolid Chriſtian, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">John 4.42.</note>, who begain to <hi>believe,</hi> upon the report of the woman, were afterwards better grounded upon the authority of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as he that <hi>bought a piece of ground</hi>

                     <p>Or, he imbraceth Religion for novelty, becauſe 'tis new, and broached at firſt by ſome ſtrange man and meanes. So the Jewes entertained <hi>John</hi> and his Baptiſme, when he firſt began to preach, and baptize<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 3.5.6.7.</note>; not ſo much out of a ſerious apprehenſion of the neceſſity of faith and repentance, as to be in the faſhion, when they ſaw that all <hi>accounted John as a Prophet</hi>

                     <p>Or, he entertaineth Religion, <hi>with respect of perſons</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Jam 2.1.</note>. His Anceſtors friends, <hi>rich men,</hi> great men, that are in place, and can preferre him, are of that profeſſion: The Rulers are of that Religion. Were there none but poore men, none but the meaneſt, the Vulgar, the out-caſts, ſuch as Chriſt in his loweſt condition; even he that could reverence <hi>John</hi> grown popular, would not own <hi>Chriſt</hi> whom <hi>John</hi> preached, when <hi>despiſed and rejected of men</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Jſa. 53.3.</note>, <hi>a man of ſorrowes and acquainted with grief.</hi> Then, will this hypocrite <hi>hide his face from him;</hi> when others <hi>deſpiſe him, he eſteemeth him not.</hi> He will not ſtand alone, as <hi>Elias</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">1 King. 19.9</note>, no, not for God himſelf; nor, as <hi>Jeremy, contend with the whole earth,</hi> when <hi>every man doth curſe him</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Jer. 15.10</note>.</p>
                     <p>Or, he receiveth Religion in oppoſition He is a Proteſtant, and that upon this very reaſon that he will not be a Papiſt: and it may be a good reaſon for the Negative. For, who would be of that Religion which turnes Chriſt out of office under pretence of honouring him, (as <hi>Herod</hi> that would worſhip him, yet meant to ſlay him;) and, cauſeth men to take him for no leſſe then a Commiſſionated God who exalteth himſelf above God and all that is called God, and is the authour, or abettor of all the Traitors, parricides, and incendiaries of the world, againſt all that oppoſe his horrid uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? But he that hath no more but this, hath but a negative Religion. He hath reaſon to be no Papiſt; but this is not reaſon ſufficient to be a Proteſtant. Theſe are good inducements to hate Popery; but, weak grounds, when alone, to take up Religion. Many ſuch Proteſtants, if the ſtreame and tide turne, quickly make as good Papiſts; as ſad experience ſheweth.</p>
                     <p>All theſe and the like reaſons make this hypocrite like a ſerpent, <hi>humi repere,</hi> but to creep upon the ground, and ſo ſtretch himſelf at length to receive the warmth of the Sun, whereas he will ſhortly creep into the dunghill, and lie hid from the cold, when winter approacheth. It is an earthen Religion; or rather, Religion in an earthy heart, which is never converted into the nature of that which is contayned in it. It may be heated by it, as an earthen veſſel by fire put into it, but never aſſimilated into the nature of it, as wood put to fire. He is an abortive fruit, born before his time, or rather never born, but a perpetual conception without birth: for, in the time of travail and trial, when he ſhould be born and begin to live, he is ſtifled, and ſticks faſt in the birth <hi>or place of the breaking forth of children</hi>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note>; that being <hi>able to build</hi> him <hi>up further, and to give</hi> him <hi>an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all them which be ſanctified.</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Acts. 20.32.</note>.</p>
                     <p>As for the World, he ſets ſo light by that, that he, preferres Chriſt having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the world, before all things in it. He ſaith to him as <hi>Peter, whither ſhall we go? thou haſt the Words of eternal life.</hi> He ſaith not, thou haſt the wealth of the world, the honour and glory of the world; he knoweth the contrary, and that unleſſe he forſake all theſe actually, when they ſtand in competition with Chriſt ſo that both cannot be enjoyed, he is no diſciple for Chriſt. Yea, and where there is no preſent occaſion of actual relinquiſhing of them, yet then they be forſaken in intention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as ſuppoſing there may be an occaſion actually to part with them, although none yet appear.</p>
                     <p>This takes away many rubs in the Chriſtian race: for what can hinder him in the purſuit of heaven that hath caſt the world behind his back? What can turn him back, that is gotten above the world, and whatever is in it that may entice and corrupt him? He is <hi>crucified to the world, and the world unto him</hi>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 21.9.</note>. But if he once find Chriſt to be apprehended, and led away to the High Prieſts Palace, and there to be ſpit on in his face and buffeted, he will with <hi>Peter</hi> deny him; and ſay, <hi>I know not the man</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 26 72.</note>: and, if this will not do, he will bind it <hi>with curſing and ſwearing,</hi> that once men may be ſatisfied that he is none of his company, So that, in this reſpect alſo, all his goodneſſe may be compared to the <hi>morning dew</hi> or <hi>cloud,</hi> which is both a fruit, and a ſigne of fair weather, becauſe the early dew of grace in the Temporary; ſhewes fair weather to have gone before, and betokens drought to follow after. For,</p>
                     <p>He beginneth to profeſſe Religion, when it is in credit and eſteem, even with thoſe that care not for it; and when it goes well with the Church, and ill with her enemies. Thus, <hi>many of the people of the Land became Jewes</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Eſth. 8.17.</note> even in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in the Land of the Jewes captivity, when they ſaw the King favoured them, and would not give them up as a prey to their enemies, but rather encouraged all to protect them: Many ſuch ſwallowes and butterflies there are, whenſoever the Church hath good dayes, that will be ſure to ſide with her in her proſperity, although in her adverſity none have more trampled on her, or done her more miſchief.</p>
                     <p>And as this hypocrite begins Religion when the Church is in proſperity, ſo he takes it up only for proſperities ſake, that he may ſhare with her in it.

                        <note n="y" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12.</note>. He never took up Religion, but as reſolving that ſome trouble would certainly aſſault him in that way.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite, takes up Religion not to honour God or Religion, but to better himſelf by it; the true Chriſtian takes it as in marriage, <hi>for richer for poorer; for better for worſe:</hi> the one, will gaine by it, or caſt it off: the other, will ſtick to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The Mould about him is ready to afford nouriſhment, but he wants an honeſt heart to ſuck and draw it in. Therefore, he cannot hold out, but growes every day more clung and withering, even in the richeſt ſoile. He is for this cauſe alſo compared to <hi>the morning dew,</hi> becauſe, as the ranker the dew, the hotter the day, and the ſooner the dew vaniſheth; ſo the greater ſhew of goodneſſe appeares in him, the ſooner it is drunk up by the ſcorching Sun of perſecution.. And as a <hi>faire morning</hi> is oft-times a ſigne <hi>of a</hi> foule day: So his early profeſſion with ſo great a promiſe of continuance, is a ſure prognoſtick that he will alter before night.</p>
                     <p>In all experience, earlyeſt things are not the ſureſt ſymptomes of future perfection. <hi>Nimis properè minùs proſperè,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> too much haſt never makes good ſpeed.

The rain-bow which in the evening is a ſigne of faire weather, in the morning is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of rayne. The haſt this hypocrite makes in the morning, and his being ſo hot upon the ſpurre, is a ſure ſigne of his tyring before night. A too forward Spring, is never the moſt fruitful yeare: the ſooner and fuller the buds and bloſſomes appear, the more apt to be nipt, and fall off before the fruit be formed and hardened. It is ill truſting of young beginners in profeſſion, when over forward, and zealous;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63232:108"/> eſpecially, if too confident of their owne reſolutions, and boaſting of them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temporary</hi> hypocrite is uſually a man hot and fierce by nature, through the predominancy of <hi>choller.</hi> This warmes and heates his affections before his judgment be throughly informed and ſetled. And hence it is that he is raſh and heady in all his undertakings; and his paſſions all in flame before his underſtanding be truly illightned. <hi>Quicquid vult valde vult.</hi> What ever he hath a mind to, he purſueth with all his might; Right, or wrong makes no great oddes with him while he is in a carrere. And commonly he moves with more violence in a wrong way (becauſe that is more ſuitable to a corrupt heart,) than when he is in the right, becauſe his motion is never more eccentrick than when he moves for God. He is then off the wheeles, and drives heavily.</p>
                     <p>His Religion is taken up out of paſſion, as well as out of deſigne to promote his own ends wherein he is paſſionately violent: this makes his beginning more ſwift, after the manner of violent motions, wherein men firſt run, beyond reaſon, and then reſt before they be at the end of the race, contrary to reaſon. Forced grounds ſend forth fruit ſooneſt, but it is but a ſower kind of graſſe that anſweres not expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It may pleaſe the eye in the ſhooting up, but it will never ſatisfie for the coſt, in the iſſue when it is grown. Who ſo ſterne and ſtrict as a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> he will <hi>faſt twice a week,</hi> he will deny himſelf not only of the comforts of life, but of the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of nature, he will whip himſelf till the blood come, and be ſo auſtere to his own body, as if that were made to be only a ſlave, and himſelf were born to be the tyrant over it.<note n="q" place="margin">1 Kin. 18.28.</note> Hence <hi>Baals Prieſts</hi> exceeded <hi>Elijah,</hi> in <hi>cutting and launcing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>

                     <p>But no violent thing is perpetual in nature, neither is any motion kindly that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds moderation in grace. A <hi>Jehu</hi> may pleaſe and applaud himſelf in his <hi>furious march</hi> to deſtroy the Idols of <hi>Ahab,</hi> to make way to his crown which he thirſteth after; but he will never pleaſe God, becauſe his zeal againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> made him forget his duty againſt <hi>Jeroboams Calves.</hi> And uſually the greateſt hot-ſpurres in ſome particular duties, are the dulleſt ſpirits in the perſuit of ſome other as neceſſarie (if not more than) that wherein they lay out ſo much labour and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
                     <p>And he that offers violence to himſelf, will not faile to be harſh and violent to others, as the Phariſees to the Diſciples; not permitting them to <hi>rub an eare of corne</hi>

                     <p>A ſtrained zeal and forced ſhew of piety makes a man froward, bitter, and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his carriage, becauſe he takes up Religion againſt the haire, to make uſe of it, not out of love and choice, but meerly for his own ends and neceſſitie: and this being not ſuitable to his temper, it ſecretly vexeth him to be cumbred with that which is ſo unſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his natural diſpoſition of mind and temper of body, which makes him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and crabbed where he hath to do. But the Chriſtian is caſt into a better mould, and the new creature in him eates out all that natural frowardneſſe and peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he is naturally ſubject to, and makes him of a Lyon to become a Lamb: to be filled with <hi>bowels of mercy, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, meekneſſe, long-ſuffering</hi>

                     <p>He joyneth himſelf unto the Church, adhereth unto profeſſors, receiveth the ſap of doctrine, but altereth the quality of it, and corrupteth it by his own evil heart, as bad ſtomacks corrupt the beſt meat, ſo that in ſtead of nouriſhment, it ſerves only to feed bad humours.

Great things are found in him and done by him, if they were not corrupted by an ill digeſtion, and turned into putrefaction by the vicious quality of the ground wherein theſe ſeedes are ſown.</p>
                     <p>But all being weighed by Gods ballance are found to be too light to be good indeed, that is, to purpoſe.

For, what he receiveth from Chriſt is not put into a dead mans mouth, which may be forced to contain it a while, but without benefit; but, he as a living member ſucks and draws more and more from Chriſt, as the branches of the Vine from the root; he corrupts it not in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the ſpider in taking in the beſt juice of the choiſeſt flowers; but, but incorporateth it into himſelfe, and is transformed himſelfe into it, and beares a lively image of him that hath created him unto good works.</p>
                     <p>He is ſo a part of Chriſt, that Chriſt can no more be without him, than he can be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63232:109"/> without himſelf, the body cannot want the leaſt member without deformity and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. <hi>The body of Chriſt is his fulneſſe who filleth all in all</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.23.</note>. How can he be empty whom Chriſt filleth? How can Chriſt be <hi>full,</hi> if he want a member?

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Phil. 1.15.16</note>, in hope thereby to breed <hi>ſtrife,</hi> between the people and thoſe that <hi>preach Chriſt of good-will,</hi> hoping to <hi>adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to thoſe</hi> who are in <hi>bonds</hi> for the Goſpel, and have more eſteem and place in the hearts of men than himſelf.

                        <note n="q" place="margin">James 4.5.</note>. This is too common in ambitious and contentious ſpirits that take up the miniſtry for advantage ſake, and reſolve to croſſe and oppoſe all whom they envy for their parts and acceptance.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Jannes and Jambres</hi> the magicians of <hi>Pharaoh, withſtood Moſes</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.8.</note>, when he began to grow more famous then themſelves for miracles in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court: ſo doth this hypocrite <hi>reſiſt the truth, being of a corrupt mind.</hi> If the Devil furniſh him with parts and opportunities, no man of eminency ſhall eſcape his oppoſition and laſh, even for maintaining thoſe very truths which this envious one once held and defended before the ſtreame and tide of the times ranne againſt them.</p>
                     <p>He is a <hi>Preacher</hi> (perhaps) <hi>of righteouſneſſe,</hi> but <hi>a worker of iniquity.</hi> He preacheth Chriſt, but hath no acquaintance with him; He never knew Chriſt, nor was known of him. This is one of thoſe many who (after all their preaching, and prateing) ſhall endeavour at the laſt day, to ſcrape acquaintance with Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, &amp;c</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 7, 22</note>? He thinks in his heart thus to ſay, and plead; and, in this opinion perhaps he dies, without diſcovering this ſelf-deceit while he liveth and believes he doth well enough; even till he come to judgement, particular at leaſt after death. So that he beares not only the world, and the Church, but his own ſoul in hand, that what he doth will ſerve his turne even before Chriſt his Judge. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to teach truth; he ſaith, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> which argues ſome fervour and zeal, as well as ſervice. Yea, he hath gifts too, perhaps more then ordinary, even to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles and the <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> if the times require it, <hi>in thy Name have we caſt out Devils, &amp;c.</hi> but all this will not ſerve in the day of Chriſt, whoſe anſwer will be a ſad proteſtation, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Verſe 23.</note>. He renounceth all acquaintance with him, paſſeth an heavy ſentence upon him, as judging no better of him than <hi>of a worker of iniquity.</hi> For, indeed, ſuch an one is declared by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to be no other but the ſtaple of all prophaneneſſe and hypocriſie, from whom <hi>profaneneſſe goeth forth into all the Land</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Jer. 23.15</note>. His wickedneſſe is wickedneſſe in the <hi>Watch-tower</hi> that may endanger all.

                     </p>
                     <p>He not only preacheth, but labours to <hi>adorne the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> And if Chriſt be preached, in truth, and ſincerity, he hath enough. For his part, he looks not ſo on his own things, as <hi>on the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He not onely <hi>ſpeaketh the things which become ſound doctrine</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Titus 2.1</note>, but <hi>is a patterne of good works; in doctrine ſhewing uncorruptneſſe, gravity, ſincerity,</hi> ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that he that is of the contrary part may be aſhamed</hi>

                     <p>He is not only an Officer commiſſionated by Chriſt, but ſo <hi>waites on his office,</hi> that he really <hi>ſerveth God with his ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Sonne</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Romans 1 9</note>. He is careful not only of his parts and gifts to make him an <hi>able Miniſter of the New-Teſtament</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6</note>, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63232:110"/> a commiſſion and calling from God, by man to exerciſe thoſe gifts which he hath received, with hope of a bleſſing. He knows that as God never ſent meſſage by the hand of a fool, ſo he never gives a bleſſing to their labours who <hi>run before they be ſent;</hi> and, that <hi>no man</hi> (who deſires to <hi>be found faithful) takes this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 5.4</note>. He looks upon the work of the Miniſtry as a diſtinct <hi>Office,</hi> which none but ſuch as are called of God unto it, can meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, without high preſumption, and ſinful uſurpation, by which they do not <hi>edefie,</hi> but <hi>deceive the hearts of the people.</hi> Never did any people thrive and <hi>grow in the grace and knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who, forſaking the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Aſſemblies, betook themſelves to ſuch Uſurpers and Impoſtors<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 5.38</note>.</p>
                     <p>And albeit he will not <hi>teach for hire,</hi> nor <hi>Divine for money,</hi> as making that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, much leſſe the ground of undertaking the Miniſtry; yet, he believes <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 10.7 1 Tim. 5 18</note>, and that Chriſt never required him <hi>to go a warfare at any time at his own coſt</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.7</note>; nor, <hi>to work with his hands</hi>

                        <note n="i" place="margin">Verſe 14</note>; and, that charge is given to every one <hi>that is taught in the Word to communicate to him that teacheth him, in all good things</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 6.6.</note>. Therefore he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the unjuſt aſperſions of earth-wormes, or ſectaries, that proclaime him an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a <hi>Balaamite,</hi> becauſe he takes maintenance; and a <hi>legal Prieſt,</hi> becauſe he takes tithes, for that he is well ſatisfied, that among other Argumens by which the Apoſtle proved Chriſt himſelf to be a <hi>Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedech,</hi> his <hi>receiving</hi> of <hi>tithes</hi> is one, foraſmuch as he receiveth them, <hi>of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 7.8</note>. But his main aime is to approve himſelf to God in the <hi>matter</hi> he delivereth as alſo in his <hi>zeal,</hi> and <hi>practiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite preacheth himſelf when he pretends moſt ſervice to Chriſt, the true Chriſtian Miniſter preacheth Chriſt ſincerely, with denial of himſelf. The one undertakes the work meerly for the wages, the other takes the wages ſet out by God, when he hath done his work; the one cares not what becomes of the ſheep, ſo he may have the fleece; the other is more carefull to feed the flock, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Preaching Hypocrite is very ambitious to ſhew Learning, without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

                     <p>He ſtands not ſo much upon ſolid and profitable matter, as to make ſhew of his own learning, therefore he pitcheth on ſuch ſubjects as he is beſt verſt in, and that may occaſion the bringing out of moſt of that ſtuffe which he calls learning, not that which is moſt needful and ſuitable to his Auditory. It is below him to be ſetting <hi>milke</hi> before <hi>babes,</hi> he is altogether for <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> for men, although his <hi>meat</hi> be rather <hi>ſtrong lines</hi> than ſtrong food, <hi>borrowed</hi> of his <hi>neighbour</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 11.5, 6</note>, rather then of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding.</p>
                     <p>There is a kind of forced learning, or rather a ſhew of it, which a ſmatterer and mean Scholar, with ſome ſtock of wit, help of Books (eſpecially of <hi>Indices) Flores, Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea's, Poſtils,</hi> and length of time ſet out upon the ſtaule, when with long turning of Books he hath made up a rapſody of ſeveral ſorts of flowers (ſome no better then gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeds,) which he calls a learned Sermon, not ſo much for the ſolidity or depth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as for the multitude of quotations of Authours, on which (ſave upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he never ſpent his time, or ſtudy. Peradventure he never ſaw the Authours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but took them upon truſt, from others who collected them to his hand. Yea, haply, he hath taken all out of a printed or written copy, and without variation, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as his own: as young ſhop keepers, having but ſmall ſtock of their own, ſet out pictures of wares in ſtead of parcels; or, as Apothecaries that paint the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of their pots and boxes with names of drugges, that are not to be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</p>

                        <note n="ſ" place="margin">ver. 10.</note> that may edifie. He will not be rude, looſe, light, vain, frothy, in his expreſſions, nor <hi>be raſh with his mouth, nor let his heart be haſty to utter any thing before God</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.2.</note>.

                        <note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.15.</note>; and albeit he would not have it taſt too ſtrongly of humane wit, yet he loves to have it ſmel of the candle. He maketh himſelf maſter of what he delivereth, and he cites with choyce; not every thing, to bring in the name of an author, or to fill up roome, but ſuch things as are pertinent, and not obſerved by every Reader of his Author. What he cites he makes himſelf owner of, ſo as to make it more uſeful and profitable than he found it. He not only reades the Authour himſelf (the meanes by which one man derives knowledg from another,) but he alſo pondereth, judgeth, applyeth and ſo improveth what he borroweth, to his own purpoſe, thereby giving it as it were a new concoction, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil</hi> that he tranſlated many things out of <hi>Homer,</hi> but made them all his own, by clothing them in a new notion, and better habit.</p>
                     <p>Although he neglect no paines or care, no ſtudy, nor art; yet he endeavours more that his Sermons may ſavour of judgment, piety, practiſe and conſcience than of wit or humane learning. He brings forth his old ſtore (which is beſt digeſted) as well as new: He will not be put to go to the Market for <hi>new,</hi> ſo long as he hath ought of <hi>the old wine</hi> (which <hi>is better</hi>) remaining: Not as neglecting to lay in new proviſion, but as chooſing rather to ſet forth that upon which he hath formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed moſt paines.</p>
                     <p>He affects not to be commended for making a learned Sermon, but is glad to heare that it is profitable. He glorieth not in making up a Sermon in a few dayes or houres, but is ready to make it out that he hath ſtudied for this all his life: His Sermon was perhaps quickly framed when he went about it, as <hi>Jacobs ſavoury meat</hi> was ſoon made for his Father, when his mother undertook it: but the <hi>Kid,</hi> the materials was at hand, and well grown <hi>in the flock</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 27.9.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It were folly to ſay to a Joyner, you have made a Table in a day or two, that I could not have done in a year. For, what marvail? He ſerved an apprentiſhip to the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63232:111"/> Trade; after that wrought journy-work for a good ſpace together, hath his hand alwayes in ure, his tooles in readineſſe, and his timber cut out, and at hand: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as another man is to learn, and to borrow all. There is great difference between a workman, and one that only now and then tryes an experiment: for this man for the moſt part doth <hi>magno conatu magnas nugas edere,</hi> toyles extremely to bring forth a bungled piece, and takes great paines to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A mean Scholar, with time, may make one of thoſe learned Sermons which this hypocrite is ſo proud of, and make ſhew of much more than ever he was maſter of. But a profitable popular Sermon well digeſted, and fit for edifying, is not made without much more judgment and experience than this hypocrite ever attayned. For, theſe, to wit, <hi>judgment and experience,</hi> work an habit without which one or a few pickt Sermons will never make an expert Preacher, no more then one learned ſpeech will make an Orator. It is the property of Art to conceal Art, when it is moſt exactly made uſe of; and, to make learning popular and familiar is the moſt infallible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a learned man.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite, like <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Act. 8.9,</note>, gives himſelf out <hi>to be ſome great one;</hi> the ſervant of Chriſt cryes out, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note>? The one being an empty veſſel, makes a greater noyce, and magnifieth himſelf without cauſe; the other, being fully taught with learning and guifts of edification <hi>dares not make himſelf of the number, or compare himſelf with thoſe that commend themſelves</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 12</note>. The <hi>one boaſteth of a falſe gift,</hi> the other improveth a real ability, to the glory of him that beſtowed it. The one takes it to be below him to attend upon Lambs, when himſelf hath not in truth a ſufficiency to feed them; the other knowes himſelf as much obliged by the great Shepherd, to feed the tender Lambs, as the ſtronger ſheep, and acknowledge himſelf a <hi>debtor</hi> even <hi>to the unwiſe</hi> as well as <hi>to the wiſe</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite brings learning, but not the true, that is, divine.</hi>

It is like worldly wiſdome, that though, as wiſdom, it came from God, yet as it uſed, it fights againſt him. It is a Cannon turned againſt him that firſt furniſhed the preſent poſſeſſor with it. Without God no man can have <hi>learning;</hi> but, for the moſt part, learning is ſo much abuſed, that none ſuffer more from the learned, than God himſelf, becauſe that when thereby they come to have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, <hi>they glorifie him not as God, neither are thankful, but become vaine in their imaginations, whereby their fooliſh heart is darkened</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note>. Chriſt hath no enemies like thoſe who have received from God moſt knowledg in the brain, without true grace in the heart. He receives moſt <hi>wounds in the houſe of his friends</hi>

Or he carries on the work of preaching as a Trade or Occupation to which he was brought up, to get wealth by, and ſo he followes it as a ſecular buſineſſe, wherein his own ends and intereſts require him to be diligent and induſtrous: for the people expect it, and muſt be ſatisfied: the market muſt be ſerved, he muſt take pains, becauſe <hi>by this craft he hath his living</hi>

He likes well that good works be viſible, yet doth it not to be ſeen; ſo he is content <hi>learning</hi> ſhoud be uſed in his preaching, but makes it not his end that it may appear. Opinion of diligence addeth reſpect both to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to the ſpeaker; therefore he uſeth it, that men may not juſtly complaine for want of it; yet aimes not at applauſe by it: <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> would never ſpeak to the people without preparation, much leſſe will he, to the people of God, in the preſence of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And ſo far is he from making preaching a ſecular employment, to get money by it, <hi>that though he do preach the Goſpel, he hath nothing to glory of;</hi> for, he looks upon it, as a <hi>neceſſity laid upon him</hi> by Chriſt, for higher ends and uſes; and, as being obnoxious to a <hi>wee if he preach it not,</hi> whether he receive pay or not<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.16</note>. He will preach whatever his allowance from men be, expecting his reward from God, with whom his work is, and for whom he worketh; and whatever he receiveth from men (which he fears not to do, becauſe God allowes it him) he reſpecteth it, not as the recompence of his work, or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63232:113"/> as that for which he worketh, but as neceſſaries while he is employed in the Vineyard, in the work of his Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite makes uſe of learning and ſpeech, as a thief doth of a pick-lock to open other mens Coffers; the ſervant of Chriſt uſeth it as a key to open the ſoule, that the Word may find paſſage into the inner-man; the one converts heaven into earth, the other raiſeth earth up to heaven; the one preacheth Chriſt, but mindeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the other, denieth himſelf that he may preach Chriſt ſincerely.</p>

                     <p>He ſpeaks not in the nature of an Ambaſſadour of Chriſt, but of a mercenary Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, who, to get benevolence, makes both his office and meſſage a proſtitute to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.

He is mighty hot towards others, yet is but luke-warm himſelf<note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 3.15.16</note>. His fire flames moſt at the Ovens-mouth, it heats not the Oven within. As there is a forme of godlineſſe, ſo this man hath a forme of zeal, that makes a ſhew, and a great light, like an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or fools fire, which never does good, but harme; it leads out of the way, rather then guides men in it.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>zeal</hi> is either <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> lighting his Torch at <hi>Seneca's</hi> fire, or other <hi>Stoicks,</hi> whoſe ſentences being very acute, and pungent, ſerve his turn, as well as if he had it from <hi>Paul:</hi> yea, better, for the zeal of <hi>Paul, David,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would make him a <hi>Puritan.</hi> But all the zeal of Heathens was but a counterfeit heat, that ſerved to warm others; as a burning-glaſſe may ſet other things on fire, without being it ſelf fired.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites zeal is culinary, or from the Kitchin; that, of the ſervant of Chriſt is fire from the ſanctuary; the zeal of the one is like fire at the mouth of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when there is none in the Oven it ſelf, he is tongue-zealous and heart cold; the others fire is moſt within; the zeal of the one is furiouſly bitter and bitterly paſſionate, the zeal of the other is ever accompanied with compaſſion, and a ſpirit of meekneſs; the zeal of the one conſumeth others, the zeal of the other ſaveth them and conſumeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

                     <p>He will not teach duties which he means not to practiſe, nor mince them becauſe himſelf is deficient in them. He will not forbear teaching, becauſe himſelf faileth in practiſe, but rather rowſe up himſelf to the doing of what he finds a neceſſity to teach. He will not therefore faile to diſplay ſinnes, becauſe he hath no mind to forego them; but rather forſake them the ſooner, becauſe he finds a neceſſity to cry aloud againſt them. He knows that <hi>more is given</hi> to him than to others, and therefore <hi>more will be required. Peter</hi> muſt love Chriſt more than others of lower rank and leſſe experience of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63232:116"/> his power and love. He muſt not only live as a Chriſtian, but ſhine as a Miniſter. A Chriſtian muſt not take all the liberty that the beſt civilized and moral Heathen doth; nor, a Miniſter all that ſome Chriſtians do. Therefore he winkes at divers things in others which he will not ſuffer in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He remembreth with holy trembling, who hath ſaid, <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 10.3.</note>. Therefore he will glorifie God in holyneſſe, and not leave it to God (as the hypocrite doth) to glorifie himſelfe, in his confuſion. He is Chriſts Herauld, and reſolves to deliver his meſſage faithfully, although it ſhould fall moſt ſharply upon himſelf; but, will be the more careful in his carriage, that he may not fall into the greater condemnation. He is willing to let the Word have a free paſſage, whereever it lighteth, becauſe he knowes it to be not only a promptuary of graces unto well-doing, but an Armory of weapons againſt the ſtrongeſt corruptions; which he not only brandiſheth, but really applyeth with moſt vigour againſt thoſe within himſelf, in hope thereby to get more ſtrength to reſiſt evil, and to follow that which is good; praying for not only his hearers, but for himſelf, <hi>Let thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and thy Thummim be upon thine holy one</hi>

                     <p>He takes pleaſure to ſee the world ſet forth in lively colours in the Map of the Word, ſo there be nothing of him in particular to lay him open in his colours.

That is the compaſſe by which he muſt ſteere his courſe, if he mean to arrive at the deſired haven; as Saylors, that compare the Coaſt with their card, and their courſe with the compaſſe.

One Sermon in a week is well: nay, one in a moneth, or in a quarter of a year (he would, if it were not for ſhame, adde, in a year) is more then he can learn and practiſe well [and, in this you may believe him:] which is as much as to ſay, a child ſhould learn but one letter at once throughout the whole book; or but one word firſt, throughout all Authors before he ſet himſelf to learn any other;<note n="c" place="margin">Socrat. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. cap. 18.</note> or that every one ſhould be like <hi>Pambo</hi> [in the eccleſiaſtical hiſtory] who deſiring to be taught the thirty nine Pſalme, after he had heard the firſt verſe thereof <hi>[I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſin not with my tongue]</hi> bad his teacher to hold there: this one verſe, ſaith he, is enough at once to learn; and he was ſo long a learning that [even above nineteen yeares] that he never went further, and ſo he remained <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>He is careful to practiſe what he heareth, but doth not upon that ground that he cannot perfectly practiſe it, forbear to hear frequently, but rather heares more often, that he may be better inſtructed, and more effectually ſtirred up to practiſe better; He finds exerciſe of the body doth not only help digeſtion, but encreaſe appetite; and that none have ſo good appetites to more food, as they that uſe moſt action. He knowes that one Sermon helps him to underſtand, remember, apply, and practiſe another: and that one Sermon is as an hammer to drive the former <hi>nailes fastened by the Maſter of the Aſſembly,</hi> to the head. He obſerveth that a child growes not one year in a leg, another in an arme; one year in one eye, another, in the other; but, in all, together, therefore he takes in food accordingly: ſo the new creature (after once formed) in a Chriſtian, groweth in all the parts together, not in one limb alone; therefore he often receiveth food, that he may have a full ſupply to carry on the whole work together, as the Maſters in Architecture give direction in building to carry up all the building together, and to avoid pawſes and intermiſſions in carrying up of the whole, till ſome one part be finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Not that he ſets no limits to his hearing, although he hear ſo often as he can; There are occaſions ſometimes offered by God in his providence, not only extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſions (as when an Oxe, or an Aſſe falleth into a pit; a child, a wiſe, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp;c. ſuddenly falleth dangerouſly ſick on the Sabbath, and there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to go for the Phyſitian, &amp;c.) but even ordinary; as the following of his lawful calling in dayes of labour; and, the private duties of Religion in his own family at times requiſite; he will not neglect his calling under colour of hearing, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> even in innocency, was ſet to till the ground as well as to converſe with his Maker: neither ſhall private exerciſes be omitted under pretence of the Publick, ſeeing <hi>David,</hi> when he had ſet up the Tabernacle, <hi>returned to bleſſe his houſhold</hi>

He will riſe more early, labour with more induſtry, and avoid other occaſions that may withhold from hearing, to redeem time to hear.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite thruſts out one duty with a ſhew of diligence in another which he never performeth, the true Chriſtian hearer is diligent in both, and ſo hath time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to heare more, even when he is moſt in learning and practiſing of what he hath heard; the one with <hi>Judas,</hi> under colour of charity to the poor, ſeekes to rob Chriſt of what is due to him; the other will not let Chriſt go without his box of precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor wholly neglect the poor, although there be but two mites left him to caſt into the Treaſury, the one pretends practiſe as a bane to hearing, the other makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hearing a ſpur to practiſe.</p>

The needle of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition makes way for the thread of conſolation, to ſowe him the faſter unto Chriſt. He ſo trembles, that he is not only moved, but removed from the way and love of evil. He trembleth, but ſo as not to depart away from God; but to work out his <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Phil 2.12.</note>; and then feares not to come again to God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; he trembles that he may tremble again to commit ſinne; and then, dares to draw near, and to caſt himſelf upon God that <hi>wounded</hi> him, to <hi>bind up</hi> and <hi>heale</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>And as when<note n="n" place="margin">Hos. 6.1.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſurrounded and taken by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> ſome fled, others were put to the ſword, others yeilded, and were ſpared: ſo it falls out in this caſe, the wicked tremble, and fly from God, or harden themſelves againſt him, and periſh by him: the godly caſt down their weapons, ſubmit to mercy, and are received to it. <hi>He trembleth in himſelf, that he may reſt in the day of trouble</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite trembles as the men of Iſrael, when the Lord ſent terrible <hi>thunder and rain</hi> in the time of <hi>wheat-harvest,</hi> for their great ſin in unſeaſonable <hi>asking of a King</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.17.</note>; the true hearer trembleth, as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he went up into the holy Mount<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 12.21.</note>.

                        <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.14.</note>. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this his joy is far from the joy that is <hi>of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For, if we look more narrowly into the hypocrites joy, we ſhall find many differences between them.</p>
                     <p>He rejoyceth in hearing, but it is rather in the gifts and excellencies of the ſpeaker, than in the Word ſpoken, as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers, that were much taken with his voice, but not all with the matter<note n="y" place="margin">Ezek. 33.32.</note>. It is his ambition and glorying that he hath a learned eminent man to his Paſtor, and that he is the diſciple of a man of note and worth, ſuch an one as <hi>Moſes</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Joh 9 28.</note>. Or he joyeth in the Word, becauſe it procures him counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and favour from men of power and authority, as being thought the better Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or Common-wealths-man for his profeſſion of Religion, as it ſometimes fals out in times of pretended reformation. Or he rejoyceth in the Word as a true Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63232:123"/> in outward things; <hi>rejoycing, as if he rejoyced not</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.36.</note>. He lets not that joy to ſettle in his heart, leſt it ſhould diſturb his beloved ſin by coming too neer it. He rejoyceth from the teeth outward, as we ſay. But if the Word be too buſie with his <hi>Herodias,</hi> or his conſcience, he is preſently dog-ſick, and throwes up all, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Word, that Miniſter an enemy which tels him the truth; and will, if he dares, reward him as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt.</p>
                     <p>His joy in the Word is like a flaſh of lightning, therefore ſudden; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, and therefore temporary; much like a fire of thornes, ſoon kindled and ſoon conſumed and extinct: ſoon hot; ſuddenly cold. In a moment he is light all over, by and by his light vaniſheth, and he is left more melancholick and mopiſh: more blind in mind, and hardened in heart.</p>
                     <p>Now, <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt is a Prophet: all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> yea, many of the Phariſees and Sadduces flock after him<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3.5 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7</note>, ſo that <hi>the Kingdome of heaven ſuffereth violence</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mat 11.12.</note>; ſhortly after, the tide is turned, and then <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt <hi>hath a Devil</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">ver 28.</note>. He is too ſowre, too ſharp, too bold; he brings the light too neere to the bleered eye of this hypocrites guilty and unſound conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Or his joy in the Word is ſecondary, not like the joy he taketh in outward things. He is delighted in the Word, but he will not be at ſo much coſt for that, as for his pleaſures, his profit or other luſts. He will ſpend more freely at a Whitſon-Ale, or in a Taverne, than he can afford to his Miniſter. He affords more time for his ſports, than for hearing; for a merry-meeting, than for a Sermon: he likes well a ſhort Sermon, and a long play; a ſhort grace, and a long dinner; he will ſuffer more for outward things, than for Religion: he will travaile further to a Bul-baiting, or to get gaine, than to a Sermon; he will contend more earneſtly for his luſts, than for the ſaith once delivered to the Saints<note n="e" place="margin">Jude. 3.</note>; Yea, he will ſooner take up the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and defence of the worſt cauſes the vileſt perſons, than of Gods cauſe, or of good men. He can better want the Word, than the world; a Sermon may be better ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, than his ſports or gain. And let him but have the <hi>calf</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 32, 1, 2.3.</note>, he can be without <hi>Moſes</hi> as long as he will: give him liberty, and take much preaching who will: he can joy in hearing, ſo he be not tyed to it. He can delight in it as in a jeſt or paſtime, when his work is done, not as in a deare friend, for whoſe company he leaves all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He can rejoyce in it when it brings him in proſperity, but takes no comfort in it when he ſuffers for it.</p>
                     <p>Finally, he is much in joy, but he is never the better for it; he expreſſeth much delight in the Word, but he growes not by it, he thrives not under it. He is ſtill like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine in the fatteſt paſture; yea, his latter end is worſe then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: his love pines away, his humility become flatulent, and degenerates into complements, or pride. His fear is taught by the precepts of men: he is <hi>ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as if he delighted much in the Ordinances, but <hi>never comes to the knowledg of the truth</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.6.</note>; or, if he do, he is ſoon turned from the truth unto fables<note n="h" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.4.</note>, even to the <hi>believing of lyes</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Theſ 2.11.</note>: for, <hi>evil men and ſeducers will wax worſe and worſe, deceiving, and being deceived</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He rejoyceth in the Word, and in him that brings it; in the Word for its own ſake, in him that brings it, for the Words ſake, and in both, as in <hi>the glory of Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 8 23.</note>. He joyes more in the meſſage then in the Meſſenger, although <hi>one of a thouſand</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Job. 23.23.</note>, yet he rejoyceth in him too, as the wiſe men did in the <hi>ſtarre,</hi> as it conducted them to their Saviour, not as it gratified their curioſity.

                     <p>He rejoyceth in the Word, as the worldling in outward things. He <hi>preferreth</hi> it, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Jeruſalem, before his chief joy</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Pſ. 137.6.</note>, It is to him as a diſcoverie of <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hidden in a field, which when he hath found, for joy thereof he ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 13.44.</note>: yea, ſo powerful is this joy, that it makes him to <hi>delight in the Law of God,</hi> diſcovering and croſſing his corruptions to the utmoſt height of oppoſition<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 7.22.23.</note>, even to a <hi>giving of Law, and bringing him into captivity to the Law of ſin.</hi> His joy is not only full, but laſting. It is perhaps not ſoon obtained: the Word firſt diſcovereth unto him both the nature, loathſomeneſſe, hainouſneſſe, and wages of his ſin, caſteth him down to hell, makes him a loſt man in his own eyes, and to cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">vtr. 24.</note>, but afterwards, it <hi>ſhewes him a well,</hi> as God did to <hi>Hagar</hi> in a mortal extremity of thirſt, and cauſeth him <hi>to draw waters with joy</hi> out of it<note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 12.3.</note>, which joy ſhall be an <hi>everlaſting joy;</hi> he ſhall obtaine joy and <hi>gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 35.10.</note>. He rejoyceth as in a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which the longer he holdeth, the better it proves, and the more joy it yeilds. He went about it with diſcretion and deliberation, and therefore holds it with more content and rejoycing; every uſing of it addes to his joy, and becomes a perpetual promptuary to further rejoycing. And albeit he ſometimes feel the Word ſharper than a two edged-Sword, yet when he finds it directed not againſt him, but his luſts, he is of the mind of honeſt Citizens who are glad of the coming of the Judge to a goal-delivery, becauſe he comes to cut off thoſe troubleſome and unruly malefactors whom they were forced to watch with much care and feare.</p>
                     <p>His joy is magiſtral and magiſtratical: it overtops all carnal joyes; and, as love caſteth out feare, ſo this joy caſteth out all falſe joyes of the hypocrite which are <hi>as the crackling of thornes under a pot</hi>

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 42.6.</note>, if this be wanting, he hath indeed no joy but this: all his ſprings are in this<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 87 7.</note>.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 66.14.</note>; a <hi>joy that remaines with him</hi>

                     <p>In a Word, it is ſuch a joy as makes him to thrive and grow by it, as herbes and plants by the warmth and influence of the Sun. <hi>He ſhall rejoyce, and his bones ſhall flouriſh like an herb</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 66.14.</note>. All joy and mirth, if not forced or counterfeited, is apt to make men fat and flouriſhing, and to lengthen out nature and the concernments and contentments of it; much more then doth ſpiritual joy make the true Chriſtian <hi>to flouriſh in old age,</hi> to <hi>be fat and wel-liking</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 92.14.</note>. He goeth to the Word with joy as an healthy man to his meat; not as a ſick man to his meat, whoſe ſtomack loathes the ſight of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite rejoyceth in himſelf, but not in the Lord, the true Chriſtian rejoyceth in God, when he cannot rejoyce in himſelf: the joy of the one is carnal, and therefore fleeting; the joy of the other is heavenly, and therefore everlaſting: the joy of the one is as a painted face without bettering the complexion, the joy of the other is true joy, and therefore not only cheereth, but every way addes to his conſolation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite is a ſeeming friend, but a ſecret foe to the Word.</hi>

                     <p>Sometimes he makes great ſhew of friendſhip, a good Sermon tickles him, ſo it bite not, as <hi>Tullyes</hi> Oration did <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but never removes him from his former bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: he is as good a friend to an enterlude that makes him weep, as to that which makes him laugh, ſo it concern not himſelf. He commends the Sermon, and lets the Preacher enjoy his liberty, as the Officers ſent to take Chriſt, did him. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 7 46.</note>, but never was the better for what he ſpake; and ſo they befriended him out of admiration, not becauſe edified by him. <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked (m),</hi> ſaid the woman to Chriſt; but if this were all, this all was nothing to make her bleſſed in him. If he commend the Preacher, he thinks that to be enough for him, and it may be ſo indeed for the Preacher (and perhaps too much;) but not enough for himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63232:124"/> to his condemnation, for applauding the Preacher who condemned this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites unforſaken ſins.</p>
                     <p>He may be <hi>almost perſwaded. Festus</hi> acknowledged much learning in <hi>Paul; Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> much force of reaſon, and evidence of Scripture, yet neither of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. He eſcapes ſtormes and Pirates at Sea, and makes ſhipwrack in the Haven, where deſtruction is no leſſe ſure, but much more miſerable. He eſcapeth the waves, and ſplits upon the rocks; he out-lives the ſtormes, and periſheth by a leak. He hath eſcaped the more groſſe luſts of <hi>Publicans and harlots;</hi> and yet is further than both from ſalvation. Or if he make a ſhew of being altogether perſwaded and wonne unto God, yet he doth but <hi>verba dare,</hi> beſprinkle God with court-holy-water, and is like the Daw, or Parret, that ſpeakes, but hath no meaning. He ſpeakes well, but <hi>Oh! that there were an heart in him</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 5.28, 29.</note>, ſaith the Lord. He will with <hi>Johanan,</hi> and his companions, intreat the Prophet to <hi>ask of God the way wherein he may walk, and the work he ſhould do</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 42.3.</note>, with great proteſtations of <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voice of the Lord whether it be good or evil</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">ver. 6.</note> in the corrupt account of fleſh and blood. But his after carriage ſoon bewrayes a diſſembling heart and tongue in all this profeſſion, which will at laſt fly out upon the Prophet and charge him with <hi>falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and conſpiracy,<note n="p" place="margin">Jer. 43.2, 3.</note> as if not God had ſent him but <hi>Baruch</hi> had provoked him to make that anſwer from the Lord: and ſhortly after, in plain termes to tell the Prophet to his head, <hi>as for the Word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Jer. 44.16.</note>. And ſo he turnes the inſide outward, and profeſſeth himſelf of a ſeeming friend to become an open enemy.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he is a <hi>ſecret foe,</hi> under a diſguiſe of friendſhip. The Word preached is a <hi>naile</hi> driven by the <hi>Masters of the Aſſemblies;</hi> which rives and drives this hypocrite farther from Chriſt than he was before. If Chriſt ſpeak but of ſpiritual eating of his fleſh, this hypocrite is one of thoſe that ſlink from Chriſt, and <hi>walk no more with him</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 6.66.</note>. There is a knot, or ſtump of infidelity, and diſobedience in his heart, that cauſeth the naile to recoile and to fly back into his face that drives it, ſo as it can take no hold. In publick he may perhaps (for his credit) diſſemble his wrath, but inwardly he is all in a flame at the Word, although with <hi>Herod</hi> he can diſſemble it, till an opportunity of revenge; which, notwithſtanding his ſeeming ſorrow; he not unwillingly layeth hold upon.</p>
                     <p>The Word is an <hi>hammer</hi> appointed <hi>to break the rocks</hi> it finds in mens hearts <hi>in pieces</hi>

The Word hath ſtirred the ill humour in him, but it is too tenacious to let go its hold and ſeat; too much impact and confirmed to be purged away. He may be moved with a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Sermon, but it is to anger, not to ſorrow. His conſcience may be troubled and terrified, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> was, at <hi>Elijahs</hi> prophecy; but never be cleanſed.

His hearing is not ſcenical to pleaſe and delight fancie; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to work upon the whole ſoul, the whole man. To his hearing he addeth meditation, for this is the life of hearing. It is the plaiſter for the wounded conſcience that feeles and complaines of the wound: they that are whole uſe it not, becauſe they do not think they need it. Only the ſoul that finds it ſelf ſick of ſin, or of love to God, finds no ſuch lenitive, no ſuch fomentation as to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the comforts of the Word.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith not, what an excellent man! but what a <hi>mighty Word!</hi> He prayſeth the Work-man by ſhewing forth the power of the Word taught by him. He hath the ſervants of Chriſt in ſingular reſpect and honour, for their works ſake; but he knowes that if he be not a doer of the Word taught by them, he requiteth their labour with no better than unthankfulneſſe and intollerable contempt. He is not only <hi>almoſt,</hi> but <hi>altogether perſwaded,</hi> as <hi>Japhet,</hi> to <hi>dwell in the Tents of Shem</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gen 9.27.</note>. He takes up bag and baggage, and removes whither God would have him, although he know not whither that be.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 66.11.</note>. He is for ſincere milk, without minglings, that he may grow the better by it.</p>
                     <p>He not only promiſeth, but voweth and thereby bindes himſelf, as by an oath, to <hi>keep Gods righteous judgements</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſ. 119.106.</note>. He gives himſelf up to the Word, and to Chriſt in it, and <hi>obeyes from the heart,</hi>

                        <note n="k" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13</note>, if the Word ſpeak comfort, he is cheared; if terrour, he is humbled; that God may, (as certainly he will) exalt him, upon all which accounts he may well make this appeal to God, <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Pſ. 119.97.</note>! Thus is he a true friend to the Word, and to all that are friends unto it.</p>
                     <p>If the Word be a <hi>naile,</hi> it faſtens him only to Chriſt. When the Goſpel exhorted to <hi>cleave unto the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, the <hi>firſt Christians</hi>

If the Word be an <hi>Hammer,</hi> he is well content his heart ſhould be beaten to Powder by it, rather than ſtand out againſt the Word. And let it be a <hi>Sword,</hi> and a <hi>ſharp</hi> one too, he is content to be diſſected by it, ſo as to have all his thoughts laid open to God and himſelf, and to have the fowleſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſcovered, that they may be the ſooner, and the better cleanſed; for which he will <hi>fall down on his face, and worſhip God, acknowledging that God is in the Minister</hi> diſpenſing the Word, <hi>in deed</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.25</note> He is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that by a ſpiritual inciſion, he may be cut for the ſtone in the heart: and that the goodlyeſt tops of his corrupt nature may be all cut off, and the ſtock cleft, that Grace may be graffed on it by the powerful Miniſtry of the Word.</p>
                     <p>If the Word be as <hi>fire,</hi> yet it is welcome: for his heart is as wax which melteth and diſſolveth by it, and not as clay that ſtands out againſt it. He hath much droſſe in him, that he deſires may be either burnt up, or ſeperated: and he cryes out, <hi>hic ure,</hi> burne and ſpare not here, ſo I may be ſaved hereafter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be <hi>as by fire</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15.</note>; If it deprive him of an hand, a foot, or an eye, he will
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63232:125"/> endure it, as knowing it to be more <hi>profitable for him that one of his members ſhould periſh,</hi> than that the <hi>whole ſhould be caſt into hell</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 5.29.</note>. He never complaines of the <hi>Hammer,</hi> but of the ſtonyneſſe of his heart that needs the hammer. Nor doth he cry out of the <hi>fire,</hi> but of the droſſe within him, which needes to be burnt up. He willingly ſuffers the ſtrongeſt Phyſick which the Word affordeth, not only to ſtirre, but to ſcowre and carry away all his ill humours, that he may once hear Chriſt ſay unto him, <hi>now art thou clean through the Word that I have ſpoken to thee</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 15.3.</note>. Which he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope for, untill by <hi>faith,</hi> applying the Word, <hi>his heart be purified</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Act 15.9.</note>. For, though the Phyſick adminiſtred to all, be, in it ſelf, all one; Yet, the Holy Ghoſt as <hi>the Spirit of faith,</hi> infuſeth and mixeth one ingredient more in the hearts of the godly, and that is faith, without which the <hi>Word profiteth not thoſe that heare it.</hi> He hath woful experience of his Infidelity, that it is aſtringent and obſtructive, it ſtops the paſſages, but faith is as opening Phyſick that mollifieth the heart and makes it capable of any impreſſion, which the Holy Ghoſt by the ſtamp of the Word ſhall make upon the heart.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is to the Word as <hi>Mical</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> who never <hi>hated him in her heart</hi>

For, how can it but highly diſpleaſe and provoke the Lord, to find this hypocrite dayly telling lies, not only to the world, and the Church, by his profeſſion without anſwerable walking; but, even to God himſelf, by a prayer that proceedeth <hi>from fained lips;</hi> and, ſo groſſely to diſſemble, not only in ſpeaking of God, but in ſpeaking to him? He that undertakes to pray, dares to tell God to his face, that he loves him, feares him, and truſteth in him; in all which, this hypocrites heart doth, or can give his tongue the lie: There is no forgery to that of counterfeiting the voice of Gods own Spirit: no mockery, like the praying God to heare and conſider, what he that prayeth conſidereth not himſelf, nor ſcarcely heares what he raſhly <hi>uttereth with his mouth before God.</hi> No marvail then, if ſuch mock-prayers be not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the boſome, empty; but, turned into ſin to him that prayeth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to abomination to him to whom they are directed.</p>

The heart may ſpeak without the tongue, and be heard without the moving of the lips; but if the tongue ſpeak without the heart, the man goes away without anſwer. There is nothing uttered before God in prayer, that turnes to profit, either for <hi>matter, manner, meaſure, time, place, or end</hi> of prayer, but the heart muſt be, <hi>Rector Chori,</hi> the chief leader of the Quire, being it ſelf firſt prepared and guided by the Spirit of Prayer.

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 27.8.</note>. He knowes that he can never ſhoot one prayer ſteddily into the throne of grace, to hit the white, untill he be able to ſay, <hi>my heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will ſing and give praiſe</hi>

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8.27.</note>, as well as of righteouſneſſe) with him it matters not. His heart is ſet upon them, and he muſt have them, whether Gods will be ſo, or not. Gods will and his ſubmiſſion to it, is a thing he eyeth not in prayer. If he conceit that what he deſireth is good for him, he admits of no other judge in the caſe, nor ſits down by any anſwer, but a grant. Not Gods will, but his own muſt be done. Yea, ſometimes he prayeth, and is importunate for things diſagreeing with the will of God, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for a King<note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam 8.5.</note>, after God had declared his diſlike of that requeſt<note n="g" place="margin">ver. 7.8, &amp;c.</note>, becauſe <hi>himſelf was their King</hi>

                     <p>This is a ſin too common in the praying Hypocrite, ſeldome doth he preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before God in prayer, but he makes bold with him in this kind, ſinning in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter prayed for. He muſt be his own carver, or like the child (as ſilly, as ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len) that will not eat his meat, if himſelf may not cut it, he flings away from God, as <hi>Naaman</hi> from <hi>Eliſha</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 King. 5.12.</note>, in a rage. This, if done with knowledge and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, is groſſe impiety, little ſhort of Atheiſme; if of ignorance, it is a fearful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſupine negligence not to informe himſelf before hand <hi>what the will of the Lord is</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.17.</note>. No wiſe man dares put up a ſuit to his Prince, but that which he thinks will be acceptable and feaſable.</p>
                     <p>And yet in ſuch ſuits he is commonly moſt importunate, even unto wilfulneſſe, (as men are naturally more violent and furious in a wrong way, than willing to make ſpeed in the right.) as <hi>Balaam,</hi> for leave to go with the Princes of <hi>Balack;</hi> the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> for <hi>Quailes;</hi> and after, for a <hi>King.</hi> And ſometimes God yields to ſuch prayers, not in mercy, but to their greater puniſhment, who would take no nay. For men never fare worſe, then when God lets them be their own carvers without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his will. So God gave the <hi>Iſraelites Quailes</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 16.12.</note>, which they asked for their luſts: but, <hi>while the fleſh was yet between their teeth, yet it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people, and the Lord ſmote them with a very great plague</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Num. 11.33</note>. So, he afterwards gave <hi>them a King in his anger</hi> [to their vexation] <hi>and rock him away in his wrath</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Hoſ. 13.11.</note>, to their greater miſery. Thus, many in their imprecations and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon themſelves, or others, are heard, ere they be aware: but, in vengeance, ſo that they have no cauſe to boaſt of their audience. Thus God heard the imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe murmurers, who wiſhed that they <hi>had died in the wilderneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Num. 14.2.</note>. And ſends them word by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as <hi>ye have ſpoken in mine cares, ſo will I do unto you, your carcaſſes ſhall fall in this wilderneſſe</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He dares not open his lips, or give way to his heart, to ask any particular, before he be aſſured that his ſuit be <hi>according to the will of God.</hi> If God make a <hi>promiſe,</hi> he pleads it. <hi>Remember thy promiſe unto thy ſervant wherein thou haſt commanded me to put my truſt</hi>

                        <note n="w" place="margin">Ezra. 8.22.</note>. If God give him a rule what to pray for, and in what order, he keeps cloſe unto it, as taking that to be warrant ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pray for any thing, God allowes and teacheth him to ask Firſt, therefore he prayeth that <hi>the will of God may be done;</hi> and then, ſo farre forth as may ſtand with that will, he asketh <hi>daily bread,</hi> that is, food, and all things <hi>convenient and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for him</hi>

                     <p>When he hath his warrant, he is bold, and cannot be too importunate, becauſe his prayer is grounded upon Gods will, ſteeled by faith, ſeconded by the Spirit, and handed unto God by his own Son, who alſo perfumeth it to make it more acceptable. Here, if God will <hi>wreſtle with Jacob,</hi> and for a long time too<note n="y" place="margin">Gen: 32 24.</note>: while <hi>Jacob</hi> is <hi>weeping and making his ſupplication to him, Jacob</hi> will not be put off ſo; no,<note n="z" place="margin">Hoſ. 12.4.</note> not when God himſelf ſaith to him, <hi>let me go;</hi> but tells him plainly, <hi>I will not let thee go except thou bleſſe me</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Gen 32.16.</note>. No more would the Canaanitiſh woman give over her conteſt with Chriſt, untill ſhe got what ſhe came for<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 15.27, 28.</note>, not that <hi>by his own ſtrength</hi> can any <hi>man prevaile</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 2 9.</note>; but he wreſtleth with God, with Gods own ſtrength, where God himſelf makes way. For the ſuit, and the Spirit of God frames it, and encourageth the heart to preſſe it home with warranty of ſucceſſe, as knowing the mind of God who alſo knoweth the mind of his own ſpirit, that is more deeply engaged in the ſuit than the ſuitor himſelf. Therefore he ſues boldly and will take no nay<note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 30.7.</note>; no, not when <hi>providence</hi> ſeemes to croſſe the <hi>promiſe</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 9.14. &amp; ver. 18.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, he is not peremptory in things doubtful, becauſe not clearely revealed. Herein he prayeth with ſubmiſſion: ſo alſo when nature, ſeeking her own preſervation, puts him to pray againſt that which nature abhorreth. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will be a follower of Chriſt, and when he hath prayed again and again, Father if it be <hi>poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me: nevertheleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note>: and again, <hi>O my Father, if this cup may not paſſe away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">ver. 42.</note>. He can tell what himſelf would have, but he chooſeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take, and reſt contented with what God would have, as well underſtanding that a friendly denial is better than an angry grant.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Rachel,</hi> that muſt have <hi>children, or die</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Gen 30.1.</note>; the true Chriſtian, is as <hi>Hannah</hi> who after ſhe had prayed ſubmitted all unto God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>went away, and did eat, and her countenance was no more ſad</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.18.</note>: the one looks only at the pleaſing of himſelf, and therefore thinkes he muſt needes have whatever he asketh for; the other lookes firſt and chiefly to the will of God, and therefore is beſt pleaſed when Gods will is done, although with croſſing of his own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus this hypocrites heart and prayer runs more naturally after earthly things, than <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Here, he is moſt frequent, moſt fervent, in his element Every hypocrite is a worldling whatever pretence he make to heaven: and the worldly mans <hi>Pater noſter</hi> begins and ends with, <hi>give us daily bread;</hi> all the other petitions do but beare this company, as the reſt of the Virgins that follow the Bride: for that alone is married to his heart. <hi>David</hi> hath taken his prayer at large, but he hath enough of him, and his prayer too, and deſires to be rid of both. <hi>Rid me,</hi> ſaith he<note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. 144.11. &amp;c</note>, <hi>from the hand of strange children, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh vanity:</hi> and, what vanity was that? this: <hi>That our ſons may be as plants grown up in their youth, that our daughters may be as corner ſtones poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a Palace; that our Garners may be full, affording all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſtore; that our ſheep may bring forth thouſands, and ten thouſands in our ſtreetes, that our oxen may be ſtrong to labour, that there be no breaking in, nor going out, that there be no complaining in our ſtreetes.</hi> Thus, <hi>there be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> but very few, who pray with <hi>David, Lord lift thou up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon us</hi>

                     <p>Not that it is unlawful to <hi>ask bread,</hi> or earthly neceſſaties; we have as good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to pray for them, in their order and rank with ſubmiſſion, as for heaven it ſelf; <hi>Godlineſſe having promiſe of the life that now is,</hi> as well as <hi>of that to come</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note>. But this hypocrite prayeth for lawful things unlawfully; either neglecting the better part of the promiſe for <hi>the things of the life to come:</hi> he deſires God to be <hi>a Sun and ſhield unto him,</hi> without care whether he <hi>beſtow grace and glory</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 84.11.</note>: thoſe whom God hath joyned he ſeparateth; or, at leaſt, minds moſt the leſſer and the worſer part, without <hi>chooſing the better.</hi> Or, if he look after ſpirituals, it is not in the firſt place: he <hi>ſeekes not firſt the Kingdome of God,</hi> the ſubſtance; <hi>and the righteouſneſs thereof</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note>, the chief commodity; but, he makes the things of this life the main thing which he firſt ſeeketh after; and, ſpiritual things the ſurpluſſage, and but as pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread and paper to wrap the other in. And therefore in praying for theſe things which concern this life, he doth not exerciſe faith, but nature. <hi>Pro ſe orat neceſſitas,</hi> neceſſity becomes her own advocate. All his prayers are but <hi>vox naturae,</hi> natures voice, <hi>not the prayers of faith;</hi> they only call out providence, not the promiſe.</p>

                     <p>Theſe he hath moſt in his eye, in his heart, and therefore in his tongue. His heart is, through grace, moſt naturally carried after theſe things, as the heart of the worldling, after things of the world. When others are for <hi>any good,</hi> he is for the <hi>light of Gods countenance.</hi> He <hi>ſeeketh firſt the Kingdome of God and the righteouſneſs thereof;</hi> leaving the reſt to God. And while the man of this world ſeekes to have his portion in this life, and his <hi>belly filled with Gods hidden treaſures</hi> of the world, and to have enough not only for himſelf, but his <hi>children</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 17.4.</note>; this man of God the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, prayes to be delivered from ſuch an earth-worme, as from a <hi>Sword</hi>

                     <p>Not that he neglecteth prayer <hi>for daily bread,</hi> becauſe he needs it, and God hath promiſed it. But that he doth <hi>è peſt liminio,</hi> as having recovered his former right and title before forfeited; not as taking them from the hand of common providence, when caſt before him, as food to beaſts: not as the main promiſe, but as neceſſaries for his ſupport and comfort in his pilgrimage. He prayeth for them not as his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but as <hi>ſprings of water</hi> neceſſary for preſent uſe, as <hi>Achſah</hi> the wife of <hi>Othniel</hi> prayed to her father for that <hi>bleſſing,</hi> after he had <hi>given a field,</hi> to her husband<note n="s" place="margin">Judg. 1.15.</note>. And when he prayeth for theſe things, it is not the voice of nature but the wreſtling of faith, becauſe he craves them by vertue of the promiſe; nor is it the language of his luſts, but the ejaculations of the Spirit; not <hi>to conſume them upon his luſts</hi>

                     <p>If he be more earneſt in prayer for ſpiritual things, it is rather for ſuch as may keep him out of hell, than for ſuch as fit him for heaven; for pardon of ſinne, rather then for power againſt it; for happineſſe, rather than holineſſe; for quieting a ſcolding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, rather than for grace to walk in the wayes of peace with God; for faith, rather than for repentance; for faith to remove mountaines, rather than to mount him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world; for heaven in hope of a Turkes Paradiſe, rather than for purity of heart to make him partaker of the <hi>Paradiſe of God</hi> with Chriſt<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 2.7.</note>: ſo that in all that he asketh of God he ſo carries the matter, that God may rather ſerve his turne, than that he may be ſerviceable to God.</p>
                     <p>Or, if he pray for grace, he is loath to be too earneſt, leſt he ſhould have too much of it, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before converſion was afraid to be heard too ſoon againſt his beloved luſt.

                     <p>Or, if he pray for grace, yet it is not with keeping off from the courſe of ſin.

                     <p>His prayers are not only ſudden ejaculations, or cold wiſhes, but premeditated, prepared petitions at leaſt for the matter of them, preſſed home, and ingeminated as minding his ſuit, and following on to ſollicite it, untill it be granted; as being in earneſt with God, and reſolving to take no denial; <hi>Blot out my tranſgreſſions</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63232:128"/> of his ſoul as if all the words he could uſe, were too few to expreſſe the ſtrength of his deſire, and the vehemency of his heart to get this petition granted.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth he pray only for pardon of ſin, but for clenſing of his ſoule; <hi>create in me a clean heart, O God! and renew a right Spirit within me</hi>

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note>. Nor is it enough for him to ſee Chriſt upon the croſſe to <hi>bear his ſins,</hi> unleſſe his <hi>old man be crucified with him;</hi> never giving over that lamentable out cry, <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> untill he finde himſelf ſo eaſed of it that he may be able to change his note, upon his deliverance from it, into that voice of joy, <hi>I thanke God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Rom: 7.25.</note>. He deſires not only a worſting of Satan, but an utter overthrow of Satans Kingdome in his heart. He prayeth not for a taſt, but a full draught of grace, yea, to be <hi>filled with all the fulneſſe of God</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Epheſ. 3.19.</note>.</p>
                     <p>He doth not only pray for grace, and <hi>open his mouth wide</hi> for God to <hi>fill it</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 81.10.</note>, but by the ſtrength of God, he puts his own hand to the work alſo; not lying ſtill in the ditch, and crying God help me; but ſtriving, by and with Gods help, to get out. Therefore he not only prayeth God to <hi>turne away his eyes from beholding vanity</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 119.37.</note>, but himſelf alſo <hi>maketh a covenant with his eyes not to look upon</hi> a luſtful object<note n="a" place="margin">Job. 31.1.</note>. He not only prayeth God, <hi>to ſet a watch before his mouth</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note>. Thus he ſeeketh in his carriage to ſecond his petitions, and not to way-lay his own prayers by his practiſe; that he may with more confidence and experience expect from God the grace which he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And as <hi>Eliſha,</hi> being to paſſe over <hi>Jordan,</hi> after <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken from him, took his mantle, <hi>and ſmote the waters, and ſaid,</hi> where is the <hi>God of Elijah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>waters,</hi> inſtantly <hi>parted hither, and thither, and Eliſha went over</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 King. 2.14.</note>. So the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian going from prayer unto practiſe, ſmiteth the waters of ſin, with the mantle of grace, falling from the God of <hi>Elijah</hi> into his lap, and ſaith where is the power and ſpirit of prayer? where is the ſtrength I prayed for? and thereby gets over the deepeſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and the ſtrongeſt torrents of his fleſhly luſts that would hinder his paſſage. And thus when he <hi>calls upon the name of the Lord,</hi> he <hi>departeth from iniquity</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note>, which is a ſure evidence that he belongs unto God, under <hi>ſeale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, even in praying for carnal (to wit, earthly) things, he is in a ſpiritual frame of heart and therefore prayeth ſpiritually even for them: for as the hypocrite is carnal in ſpirituals, ſo, the true Chriſtian is ſpiritual in carnals: and deſires them only <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> that he may by them be better enabled to <hi>honour God with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 3.9.</note>, and to make a ſpiritual uſe thereof, uſing faith to ſpiritual, not fleſhly ends: not as the rich worldling, ſaying to his ſoule, <hi>take thine eaſe, &amp;c.</hi> but as <hi>Davids ſoule to God, my goodneſſe,</hi> or benificence, <hi>extendeth not unto thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 16.12.</note>. He lookes upon them as ſurrogated by God, in his room to receive his bounty; <hi>firſt giving his own ſelf to the Lord, and then</hi> unto his ſervants <hi>by the will of God</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.5.</note>: and ſo he makes a heavenly uſe and improvement of the good things of the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite when he prayes to God for ſpirituals, is like thoſe <hi>Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> that pronounced <hi>Sibboleth</hi> inſtead of <hi>Sſhibboleth,</hi> and were cut off by the <hi>Gileadites</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrite, in prayer is altogether againſt formes, or lookes most at formes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Either he throwes away all formes, or he is more for forme then for ſubſtance, for the clothing, then for the body: and more for the body, then for the Spirit of prayer. The <hi>bodily exerciſe,</hi> whether within forme, or without, is his Darling, how void ſoever of the life and power of <hi>the prayer of faith.</hi> Not that every one who uſeth a <hi>forme</hi> of prayer, is an hypocrite; no more than every one that prayeth without a ſet forme, is ſincere. There is a difference to be put between no forme at all, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all but forme, either of them may be nought, neither of them abſolutely good, or ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>All formes are utterly hateful unto ſome ſpirits, who will have no formes at all, in whom yet there may be deep hypocriſie. The Spirit of prayer lies not in a gift to conceive a prayer in our own words according to the occaſion, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> without all premeditation: although this be an excellent gift, eſpecially in a Miniſter, Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlder, or other that is to be the mouth of the company in prayer. But yet ſuch as an hypocrite may attain unto (as well as to the gift of prophecy) by uſe, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearing of the words and prayers of able Chriſtians, by reading, memory, and boldneſſe, many become both able to expreſſe their petitions in fit words, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (haply too forward) to ſhew their faculty; being proud to be the mouth of the company, and fitted and affected more or leſſe according to the company. And from the pride of their extemporary gift, they eaſily grow to extravagant and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent petitions, vain repetitions, and (which is more ſinful and dangerous) to a looſe and unreverent boldneſſe with the Lord; ſo that, praying in company, they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63232:130"/> either cool the zeal of the company, or make them afraid to joyn with them: many of Gods dear children may want that natural <hi>Anamneſtes,</hi> or art of memory, through defect of education, uſe, or conſtitution; but they have all that ſpiritual <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer</hi> which at all aſſaies <hi>helpeth their infirmities</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> and <hi>bringeth to their remembrance whatever is meet to be ſaid unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This hypocrite therefore in praying may conceive a prayer well, without a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and yet be but formal: yea, and in expreſſing thoſe conceptions, may feel ſome warmth of affections (becauſe pleaſed with the child of his own brain;) yea, he may ſhed <hi>teares</hi> in prayers, as <hi>Eſau</hi> for the bleſſing, which both before and after he deſpiſed. Nor is it unlikely, but, while good notions paſſe through his head, and good wordes through his lips, ſome good motions alſo ſhould ſtirre in his heart. But they are but ſparkes which fly out at the tunnel of the Chimny that ſuddenly vaniſh. So that God may ſay of them as of the good words of old <hi>Iſrael, they have well ſaid, all that they have ſpoken; O that there were ſuch an heart in them, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 28.29.</note> that is, an heart anſwerable to their tongues, which he knew to be wanting.</p>
                     <p>Or, on the other extreame, he is all for forme, pleaſing himſelf in a forme of words, not becauſe more ſpiritual, but becauſe more eaſie and familiar: not becauſe they better expreſſe our wants and deſires, but becauſe they ſuit better with a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart. Men are loath to be at too much paines to draw up their petitions, and more unwilling to lay open their hearts too farre in a more particular confeſſion of ſins, which general formes will eaſe them of. They like well the ſhort prayer of the <hi>Publican</hi> confeſſing ſin in the general (although not with his Spirit) <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> but, not to labour as <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>Penitentials,</hi> to lay open particular ſinnes. By this meanes it comes to paſſe, that he repeateth the words of another, without ſight or ſenſe of his own peculiar wants or ſinnes, as many men by often ſwearing come to be altogether ſenceleſſe of the ſin; and without ſpiritual affection to the thing deſired, much more without deſiring any thing not mentioned in the forme; for, he accounteth it needleſſe, as holding the <hi>forme,</hi> how general and ſhort ſoever, to containe as much as he needeth to deſire.</p>
                     <p>He that is ſo ſuperſtitiouſly wedded to this of a forme, that he accounts all other prayer but babling, declares plainly that he is a ſtranger at home, and that he is of opinion that he needes to go no further in ſearching out his own ſinnes, than to his <hi>Prayer-Book;</hi> being loth to heare conſcience ſpeak in his eare, much more in the eares of others any more then general failings and frailties which no man is free from; and, which he thinkes he may without prejudice, more freely confeſſe, it being no more than every one knowes by himſelf. But (as the Wiſe man<note n="h" place="margin">Eccleſ. 34.17.</note>, ſaid truly) <hi>a mans mind is ſometimes wont to tell him more then ſeven watch-men that ſit above in an high Tower.</hi> And let the forme be what it will, he cannot pray for every thing by book: other mens words cannot alwayes expreſſe what he ſometimes hath moſt need to crave; normeet with and rip up thoſe more ſecret ſins that he hath need to confeſſe; no nor haply his own words neither; no nor yet the words preſcribed of God, unleſſe he bring a Spirit to thoſe words, to animate them, and to make them extend to reach all his wants, by putting under thoſe generals ſo many particulars as they naturally comprehend under them, and he hath need to enumerate in his prayers, to make his prayer effectual.</p>
                     <p>It is an eaſie matter for the hypocrite to ſay <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> with his mouth, but, as <hi>no man can ſay that as Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3.</note>; as believing it, and receiving benefit by him, ſo no man can cry <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> with faith, feeling, and affection, but he that hath <hi>received the Spirit of Adoption</hi> enabling him thereunto<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note>: The more dextrous and ready therefore, he is in his formes, the further off he puts ſpiritual praying, and the Spirit of prayer from him</p>

                     <p>He is for the ſubſtance and life of the duty, that his <hi>prayer may be ſet forth before

                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 141.2.</note>, in what manner ſoever uttered.</p>
                     <p>He refuſeth not the help of all formes, eſpecially in publick, wherein God himſelf had a hand in preſcribing them for publick uſe. <hi>Aaron</hi> had his forme of bleſſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed<note n="l" place="margin">Num. 6.23.</note>. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> kept the <hi>Levites to the Words of David, and of Aſaph the Seer;</hi> who <hi>ſang praiſes with gladneſſe, and bowed their heads and worſhipped</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Hoſea 14.12</note>; as being ſpiritually affected therewith, although they kept to thoſe formes. And even ſuch words, when uttered with the heart, are acceptable <hi>calves of the lips</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Hoſea 14.12</note>. Yea, and in his more private devotions, if he be ſlow of ſpeech, unable to compoſe a prayer of his own inpertinent expreſſions and apt method fit for others to joyn with him in, he can without ſcruple, or prejudice make uſe of printed or written bookes that ſuit beſt with his occaſions and neceſſities, and which ſavour moſt of the Spirit of prayer in the matter, and compoſure. Becauſe this, in time, will bring him to pray in his own words by imitation; and, in the meane time, furniſh him for the exerciſe of prayer in his family, or with others, when not fitted to ſpeak before others in his own words, which yet he maketh his own by pouring out his heart with the words he readeth, or heareth read unto him: hereby alſo he holds up the reverence and honour of the duty: for though God will bear with many ſoloeciſmes in the private cloſet-prayers of a devout ſoul; yet unto men, unapt and rude expreſſions (although coming from an honeſt heart) are either tedious, or ridiculous and occaſion their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods name in vain; as is too often ſeen in many that are proud of their own parts. Thereby alſo is he put in mind of ſundry petitions for private prayers, which of himſelf he thought not of; to confeſſe ſundry ſins which he took no notice of, and to ſtirre up good affections, which he may the more eaſily renew in the ſame or the like words in his ſecret devotions.</p>
                     <p>He uſeth holy prayer, not as acting a part of wit, memory, or rhetorick, as cunning beggars that make a trade of begging; but, as a duty, and as a work of wiſdome and grace; and therefore he takes that way wherin he may beſt glorifie God, and do moſt good to himſelf in the due performance of it. If he cannot go without crutches, he is not aſhamed to uſe them, rather than ſtumble and fall by the way.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, he tyeth not himſelf nor the Spirit of God to a ſtint, or a forme of Words, never to vary upon any occaſion. Nay, variety of occaſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate Gods people that would aptly expreſſe themſelves to God, to vary their very publick formes, as well as more private addreſſes. For this makes them expert beggars and prevalent ſuitors at the throne of grace: for a Chriſtian having variety of wants and complaints, wanteth for no ſuits, and variety of ſuits makes him to ſuit himſelf accordingly with words, wherein to put up his petitions; at leaſt in private; or, if not with words, with groanes, that ſpeak, and ſpeak more then other mens words. It is enough to God, if the heart ſpeak, although the voice be inarticulate. We heare of no words uttered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God cryes out unto him, <hi>let me alone that I may deſtroy them</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is more for the mouth than for the heart, for a ſound or forme of words, than for the mind of the Spirit; the true Chriſtian is more for the heart than for the lips: the one keepes a ſtirre about or againſt words, the other lookes above all things that his <hi>prayer</hi> [whatever his words be] <hi>proceed not forth of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lips</hi>

He is more glad he is at the end of his prayer, then when he began it. <hi>Amen,</hi> is the beſt word in it, not becauſe 'tis the word of his faith, but the cloſe of his prayer He is more glad of ſomething that followes after, than of the prayer it ſelf: and he more willingly goes to pray with an eye to that, than to <hi>ſee him that is Inviſible.</hi> After prayer, he ſhall go to dinner, to play, to bed, therefore is very glad to heare you call to prayers: he comes to it with all his heart; but it is for the belly, the bones, &amp;c.

But unto this hypocrite a meere drudgery which were it not for ſome other end, he would never be tyed unto.

                     <p>Deſires after him whom his ſoule loveth, ſtirreth up prayers, and prayers obtain ſatisfaction, and ſatisfaction procureth joy. This brings God and the Chriſtian to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as two lovers, who take pleaſure and joy in one anothers company; and make the Chriſtian to break out into ſinging, <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard the voice of my prayer</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 18.1.</note>. As <hi>David,</hi> he <hi>goes to the houſe of God with the voice of joy and prayer</hi>

                     <p>Yea, the time of prayer is the beſt and ſweeteſt time that the Chriſtian enjoyeth on this ſide heaven. Therefore though he yield to the neceſſities of nature, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; yet is he ſorry that ſo much time muſt be ſpent upon them, and withdrawn from this exerciſe of prayer; but glad to think of that day wherein prayers ſhall be wholly turned into praiſes and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> for ever. And although corruption be

                     <p>He not only neglecteth occaſions and opportunities of prayer, eſpecially in ſecret (which he cares little for,) but alſo checketh and ſuppreſſeth many motions thereunto in his own heart; or, if he give any way thereunto, it is with an unwillingneſſe; with laying hands upon the movings of his ſpirit that they may not exceed ſome ſhort come-off with God, as men that care not how few words they uſe to them, of whom they are weary. Sometimes he is for ſuperfluitie of words, ſo that he runnes out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vain repetitions, not only unto tediouſneſſe, but even unto nauſeouſneſſe or loathing, as <hi>the Heathens, who think to be heard for their much ſpeaking</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 6.5.</note>, as the Prophets of <hi>Baal from morning even untill noon</hi>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 38.9.</note>. He concealeth nothing, ſuppreſſeth nothing, opens all the windowes of his ſoul, breakes up the fountain of that great deep, that nothing ſhall be reſtrained or diminiſhed.

He is afraid to ſcant God in prayer (eſpecially when the Spirit of prayer jogs him by the elbow) leſt God abridge him in his graces and comforts; or, that his enemies ſhould exceed him in devotion, and that God ſhould heare their bawling to his prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as thoſe that <hi>ſwallowed up the needy</hi> by <hi>making the Ephah ſmall, and the ſhekel great</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>When nothing is (in his account) to be gotten by his prayers (as what thinkes he ſhall I get by praying long in ſecret, where no body ſees me, nor mindes me?) he is ſhort enough, as we ſaw but now. But when either affectation to be ſeen of men, or his belly, avarice, and <hi>an heart exerciſed with covetous practiſes,</hi> call forth his prayers, there he needes rather a gag than a raw egge; If any body will take notice of him, applaud him for his excellent gift in prayer, and point after him and ſay, <hi>this

If he mean to make a gain of his devotion, away he gets to ſome rich widdow or other women of eſtates, and there he will be very devout, frequent, fervent, large in prayer: this is not his main buſineſſe there, he aimes at ſomewhat elſe, by cauſing her either to ſpend upon him, or to give unto him, ſo long till ſhe want it her ſelf.

                     <p>And, indeed all prayers of the hypocrite are long, too long, although never ſo brief: either, becauſe the words out-go or go without the heart; there, even two words are too many: when men <hi>draw neere</hi> to God <hi>with their mouthes and lips,</hi> but <hi>with their hearts</hi> are <hi>farre from him</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 29.13.</note>. Or when men repeat the ſame things over and over again, to make up the talee of their prayers; as Papiſts, their <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> and <hi>Pater-Noſters,</hi> by fives, ſevens, and tens, or any other number, preſcribed by their Prieſts to their ignorant and ſuperſtitious Devoto's, that think they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſerved God, and merited too, by ſaying their prayers (which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not) untill they have runne them up to ſuch a number.

Nothing muſt be left out of the prayers, for the Sermon: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the Sermon ſtand by, or be abbreviated; not that this hypocrite is ſo much in love with prayer, but becauſe out of love with preaching, that ſometimes flies at his boſome and takes his luſts by the throat. Such were thoſe Hereticks of old called, <hi>Euchitae, tantùm orant, alias otioſi</hi>

If occaſion requireth he can enlarge; if neceſſity call for abridgement he can contract. Not the voice, but the heart makes the muſick in Gods eare, and in his own eſteeme too: if theſe go together, he ſticks not at length.</p>

                     <p>His heart having firſt begun the work, wordes are ſeldome wanting, eſpecially to an experienced Chriſtian, <hi>an old diſciple:</hi> but yet he had rather want words, than matter; and both than ſpirit: he is not curious of his words, but careful of his heart; Nor will he let the Mill go longer, than the heart affords water enough to drive it, although he ſhut down much ſooner than he intended, to prevent hurt and damage to himſelf. He prayes ſoberly and reverently, as to a wiſe and mighty God, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that of <hi>Solomon, Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He uſeth prayer to ſanctifie other duties, not to exclude them: to draw down a bleſſing upon them, not to deprive himſelf or others of them. Prayer fitteth him better for every other duty; and every duty duly performed fitteth him better for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer. Therefore he exerciſeth himſelf unto all duties, that by their joynt force and mutual aſſiſtance, he may gain the more, and go on with more comfort. Chriſt had his times for Duties, for praying as well as preaching, for preaching as well as praying. He prayed much, yet he did not only pray. In the evening he went to the Mount of Olives to pray; and early in the morning, returned into the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63232:134"/> Temple to preach. The Chriſtian therefore will ſometimes abbreviate his prayers, at leaſt <hi>vocal:</hi> not that he may withdraw himſelf from God, but that he may performe duties to men.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is found with <hi>the ſcant meaſure that is abominable</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Mica. 6.10.</note>; even in the meaſuring of the things of God, and thereby ſcanteth, yea robbeth both God and man of their due proportions, the true Chriſtian obſerveth his rule even in theſe things as well as in other matters; he will <hi>do no unrighteouſneſſe in mete-yard, in weight or in meaſure</hi>

                     <p>Or, if he pray at ſet-times; they are for the moſt part times of his own, or of mans ſetting: and beyond that you cannot drive him. In a <hi>Lent,</hi> eſpecially upon a <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> he hath a great praying fit upon him, which is no better then <hi>Sauls</hi> fit of prophecy.

He conſiders not that there are times and ſeaſons wherein <hi>God will be found,</hi> as there was a time wherein, <hi>Saul</hi> (had he had eyes to ſee it) might have been eſtabliſhed in the Kingdome: but that being let ſlip, there will after no place be found for repentance in God, to give ſuch another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Thus as negligent Suitors loſe their <hi>molliſſima tempera fandi,</hi> their beſt opportunities of ſpeeding, and therefore never ſpeed, ſo this hypocrite miſſeth of the acceptable time, of the day of ſalvation wherein God might be found, becauſe he will never come at God but when himſelf pleaſeth.

Although the Lord do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appear in granting his petition, yet he knowes that importunity will at laſt prevaile even with unjuſt men<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note>; much more with the faithful God: therefore minding of the parable of his Lord, <hi>that men ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">ver. 1.</note>, He will pray, and wait, and <hi>watch,</hi> and pray again, untill he receive an anſwer of his prayers. He will not only direct his prayer unto God, but he <hi>will look up</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 5.3.</note> as a man that lookes after the arrow that he hath ſhot out of his bow. Yea, if God be in a way of judgement, yet <hi>even in the way of his judgements will he wait for him</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 26.8.</note>, obſerving and ſerving his providence in every change of it, never giving over till he hath obtained <hi>grace to help in time of need.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, he prayeth alwayes as a ſuitor at Court, who doth not deliver a new petition every moment, yet is a conſtant petitioner untill his buſineſſe be diſpatcht. He is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Gods way, ſtands in his eye; and, by his very countenance and carriage, lets God underſtand plainly enough what he would have, and what he waiteth for; and therefore is never out of mind, nor without hope of a bleſſing, which is there, and not elſewhere to be found. He is grown expert and skilful by his waiting, when to take his opportunities of time and place to advance his ſuit both for ſpirituals, and temporals. His wants are continual, he muſt have daily bread, pardon of ſin daily, he is every houre ſubject to many evils and tentations, therefore he prayes daily, and never gives over at leaſt in his heart and affections, in his thoughts and ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in his frame of ſpirit to the duty, and in the actual performance of it upon all occaſions and opportunities: ſo that longer than he is praying, he is out of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is not himſelf. Thus by prayer he <hi>walketh with God,</hi> as <hi>Enoch;</hi> he is ever in his way, and eye: no gratious opportunity can eſcape him.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite will ſerve God only by fits and ſtarts, when he liſt himſelf: the true Chriſtian ſerveth him at all times without intermiſſions or out-lips. The one prayeth as Mariners at Sea in a ſtorme, but the ſtorme being over their devotion is at an end; the other is as aged <hi>Anna the Propheteſſe,</hi> who <hi>ſerved God with faſting and prayer day and night</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 2.37.</note>; the one prayeth not at all, becauſe he prayeth not alwayes, the other prayeth alwayes (although he do many things beſide) becauſe he neglecteth no opportunity of praying.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite if he pray in adverſity, he caſteth off prayer in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</hi>

                     <p>He never troubles God, but when God troubles him. In health, wealth, peace,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63232:135"/> he can comfort himſelf. He never prayes but in trouble: <hi>in his affliction he will ſeek God early</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Hoſ 5.15.</note>. God is faine to <hi>go away and return to his place,</hi> elſe this man would never look after him. When God hath touched him, he acquaints God with his miſery, but when times grow better with him, he excludes God from his mirth. He is of the mind of <hi>Ajax</hi> in the Tragedy; with God, a coward can overcome; but, a valiant man may do it, without God. He makes uſe of God, as of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend: if he be in any great extremity, and can make no other ſhift, God ſhall then heare of him; he will try what God will do for him at a dead lift; as Mariners in a ſtorme; as the Iſraelites that could ſtand it out no longer, <hi>when he ſlew them, then they ſought him</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſ 71.34.</note>: ſo will he, not before, nor yet after; but hardeneth his heart as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo ſoon as the plague is over.</p>
                     <p>Moſt men in ſickneſſe and in diſtreſſe run to God for cure, that at other times have no remembrance of him. When they would have him to do any thing for them, that none elſe can: then they come about him as the young man in the Comedy; <hi>O mi Pater!</hi> but, deſerve to be anſwered as he was, <hi>Quid mi Pater? quaſi tu hujus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeas Patris.</hi> What do you come <hi>now with</hi> my Father, <hi>in your mouth? as if forſooth you wanted this poor old man, whom you have ſo long ſcorned.</hi> So God will anſwer thoſe who ſcrape acquaintance with him in their troubles, and hang about him in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery for deliverance, as ſometimes the Prophet anſwered <hi>the King of Iſrael</hi> coming to enquire of him; <hi>Go to the Prophets of thy Father, and to the Prophets of thy mother</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">2 King. 3.13.</note>. They run to God in extremity, who afterwards think of him, as a woman paſt child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of a mid-wife, as a luſty youth of a Phyſitian; and, of prayer, as of a potion. Thus this hypocrite <hi>through the pride of his countenance,</hi> in his proſperity, <hi>will not ſeek after God; God is not in all his thoughts</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Pſ. 10.4.</note>: therefore, no more will he be in Gods, when his hand is gone out againſt him. He will <hi>laugh at their calamity, and mock when their feare cometh</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Prayer is not only his ſupport in trouble, but his delight in triumph. In affliction he prayeth, for his comfort; in proſperity, for the ſanctification of it. He ſeeth as great cauſe of returning to Chriſt, after healing, to give thankes, as there was at firſt to come to him for cure. He is as willing to acknowledge a debt, as to receive a favour: and to do his homage, where he cannot ſatisfie his rent. All the ten Lepers were haſty to come for cure; but only one (by Nation a Samaritan, but in heart an Iſraelite) came back to <hi>give glory to God</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Luk 12.15.</note>. He knoweth that prayer is ordained not only to procure good to himſelf, but to give honour to God<note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 50.15.</note>. Therefore he willingly offereth thoſe voluntary and votary ſacrifices, which the hypocrite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, when his need is over.</p>
                     <p>If he never prayed in earneſt, till he was in a ſtrait, as <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> and the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal that had not God whipt them home, would never have come of themſelves; yet though he began then, he will not end there. If he never <hi>poured out a prayer to his God till his chastening was upon him:</hi> It is becauſe he was not before converted. Sometimes his life as a Chriſtian, begins <hi>in praying,</hi> as a childs in crying: ſo did <hi>Sauls</hi> (who afterward was called <hi>Paul</hi>) to whom God ſent <hi>Ananias</hi> to comfort him, and that upon this account, <hi>for behold he prayeth</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Act. 9.11.</note>. Affliction may make ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians take up prayer, but then grace will never ſuffer them to lay it down again: His reſolution is, <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord as long as I live, I will ſing praiſe to my God while I have my being; my meditation of him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the Lord</hi>

                     <p>Sometimes he prayeth in adverſity, but then he will not pray in proſperity: on the other ſide, he ſometimes prayeth in proſperity, but then he refuſeth to pray in adverſity. He will never come up to both. He is but almoſt a Chriſtian; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be entire in duty. What he will do, he will do. If God require more, he muſt do it himſelf, if he will have it done.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite out of ſelf-love, may have ſome kind of tenderneſſe towards God, and relenting for his hard opinion of him in former times, through apprehenſion of Gods ſuppoſed love, which he gathers from theſe outward things that are ſo ſweet and ſavoury to him, and loved dearly by him; therefore he cannot but take it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God is ſo liberal to him: upon which account he may be in ſome ſort thankful for what he hath, and go to God for more. But in adverſity he thinks the Lord deals hardly with him, and handles him too roughly: therefore he <hi>cryeth not, when he bindeth him</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Job 36.13</note>. He returneth not to him that ſmiteth him neither doth he ſeek the Lord of Hoſts<note n="f" place="margin">Iſa 9.13</note>. The rods put him out of love with the hand that uſeth it, and makes him really to do what Satan (who knew the nature of hypocrites, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the power of grace) undertook <hi>Job</hi> ſhould do, namely <hi>to curſe him to his face</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Job 1.11</note>. So that wretch, in a time of extream famine, Behold this evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer<note n="h" place="margin">2 Kings 6.33</note>?</p>
                     <p>So, in trouble of conſcience (which to the hypocrite is his firſt taſt of hell) he is ſcar'd away, as <hi>Cain from the preſence of God,</hi> who fell <hi>to building of Cities</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 4.17</note> to put the curſe out of his mind: In a word, inſtead of praying there is no voice comes from him, but that of murmuring and quarrelling, as if Gods <hi>wayes were not equal,</hi> or juſt: like the vaſſals of Anti-Chriſt, <hi>who gnawed their tongues, and blaſphemed the God of heaven becauſe of their paines and their ſores, but repented not of their deeds</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 16.10</note>.</p>
                     <p>The hypocrite when he is at eaſe and hath nothing to diſturb or diſcourage him, may by ſome helpes of education, natural parts, common illumination, and meditation, make a ſhift to pray, and that eloquently, and aptly, to the admiration of many that hear him, yet without the ſpirit and life of prayer; But when <hi>the floods of great waters</hi> come, then he failes. Prayer indeed is a ſpiritual work, but is many times done carnally. He brings the body of the ſacrifice, and is his crafts-maſter in killing and dreſſing it, and laying the ſeveral parts and peeces in due order upon the Altar, but he wants fire to burn and conſume it: at leaſt, he wants the fire of the Sanctuary. It is ſtrange fire, if any, that he puts to his ſacrifice, and ſo it cannot be <hi>acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> It is a fire kindled by a burning glaſs in the ſummer of proſperity; not fire from heaven, that will keep in, in the winter of tribulation.<note place="margin">Differ:</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian prayeth as well in woe, as in weale.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He draweth water with a double-bucket, whereof the one is going down while the other is coming up. If one be coming up in his proſperity, the other is going down into the <hi>wells of ſalvation</hi> in his greateſt extremity. And although the ill natur'd child, and the baſtard, the hypocrite runs away when he is beaten, as fearing his father more than he loves him, yet the true child of God ſubmits to his fathers correction, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he uſeth moſt ſeverity. Not <hi>fainting when rebuked of him</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 12.5.</note>, much leſſe running from him. Correction diminiſheth not his love and duty, but rather addes more filial fear and reverence thereunto; making him no leſſe natural, but more reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective; nor leſſe ſerviceable, but more diligent; no leſſe confident of Gods favour, but more careful to recover and keep it. <hi>In his affliction he will ſeek God early</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15</note> and ply him with moſt diligence.</p>
                     <p>Affliction therefore is noted as a ſpecial time and occaſion laid hold upon by a child of God to pray. <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray?</hi> As if prayer were never more in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then when God not only layes on troubles, but goes away and hides his face: Then is his child moſt earneſt to ſeek him, not giving over till he hath not only found
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63232:136"/> him, but overcome him by his prayers and teares: then is he moſt forward, moſt hopeful, filling heaven with the ſighes of his heart, till his heart come to befilled with heavenly comforts.</p>

                     <p>He hath no ſpecial or ſecret errand to the Lord, which none can utter, nor muſt know, but God and himſelf. He pretends that he hath nothing to ſay to God, but he cares not who heareth it. He hath no ſecret ſins that he meanes to rip up, no particular wants that he is willing to be known of, no ſpecial graces that he cares to be a ſuitor for.

If he may be heard as others, or for others, and fare as they do (as the ignorant Papiſts) it is all he ſeeketh. More would but put him to more labour, which he likes not. Or,</p>
                     <p>He is afraid of God, if with <hi>Jacob,</hi> he come to him <hi>alone</hi>

                     <p>And, if after all this, he do ſo ſteele his heart and face, as to give God a meeting in private: he is in <hi>little eaſe</hi> till he be diſmiſſed.

                     <p>Nor is it his meaning to refuſe or put by all private prayers, in down-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termes; but, he is for the publick prayers of the Church, as being much better, and more acceptable to God, then the private devotions of a few particular men.

                     <p>Prayer in general, diſtinguiſheth a profeſſor from perſons openly profane.

                     <p>To him all the world is Gods houſe, and every houſe <hi>an houſe of prayer,</hi> every cloſet a <hi>Chamber of preſence,</hi> and every place a Temple for ſpiritual worſhip. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not be tyed to ſolemn places or times, but takes the advantage of all for promoting his ſuites. He that hath an earneſt ſuit, waiteth not, till the King ſit down in the chaire of ſtate, but watcheth where he may ſooneſt come at him, and delivers his petition where ever he meeteth him. So the Chriſtian who is more for ſeriouſneſſe than ſolemnity, preferres his prayer where ever God can be found. He hath ſome ſuites to move to the Lord where ever he meets him.</p>
                     <p>But, as Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> in that ſpecial ſuit, ſingled out the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> at a private Banquet in her <hi>own houſe</hi>

                     <p>He is not content to ſee or meet the King with others in publick ſhewings of himſelf, but he muſt be as <hi>Huſhai,</hi> the Kings <hi>companion</hi>

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 15.15</note>. He hath no intimate acquaintance with God that hath not ſomewhat to ſpeak in his eare, and to poure into his boſome, which all muſt not heare, and which the Miniſter himſelf cannot hit upon.

                     <p>If he be a ſervant, he is glad of the night, not only as the end of his work, but as affording opportunity to pray privately to his beſt friend, and deareſt love: and to take up his <hi>ſong in the night</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 77.6</note>. If lovers cannot come together by day, how hard ſoever they have wrought all day long, and how narrowly ſoever they be watched, they will make an hard ſhift to ſteale an opportunity of meeting in the night, when others are in bed and faſt aſleep.

                     <p>He is glad of ſolitarineſſe, after the manner of <hi>lovers</hi> too: therefore he ſhunneth, not only ill company at all times, but alſo good company at ſome times: becauſe all company, leſſe or more hindreth him from private enjoying of his beloved. He can make uſe of any place to converſe with God; of a mountaine, as Chriſt of Mount Olives, <hi>Moſes</hi> of Mount <hi>Nebo;</hi> and, of the houſe-top, as <hi>Peter;</hi> not as being neerer heaven, or out of ſuperſtition, but as more remote from company and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and ſo more elevated above the world; and to ſee the Hill, as a finger pointing him to heaven-ward. He can alſo do as much in a Dungeon, as <hi>Joſeph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is glad of pnblick prayer, to avoid private, as a man is to beſtow a few cold complements in the ſtreet upon him than he is loth to entertaine at his houſe; the true Chriſtian is as a man that meeteth in the ſtreet a friend whom with great joy he <hi>carrieth home to his houſe,</hi> and is loth to part with him<note n="u" place="margin">Cant. 3.4</note>.

                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8</note>. But his main care is for ſpiritual, sby how much the ſoul is more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the body; here he prayes that he may have plenty, that he may be <hi>bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Christ</hi>

                     <p>In praying for others he obſerveth the ſame rule, the ſame fervency, which he doth in praying for himſelf.

He prayeth, either thus, <hi>Da ut dem,</hi> enable me to help them; or at leaſt, <hi>Da ut dent,</hi> furniſh them to miniſter unto me. Thus whom he cannot help with his hand or purſe, he helpeth them with his prayer both in hand and purſe; in body and in ſoul, in <hi>carnals</hi> and in <hi>ſpirituals,</hi> that they may be every way the better for him, and <hi>find by experience</hi> as <hi>Laban</hi> did, <hi>that the Lord hath bleſt them for his ſake</hi>

Let him firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Preaching, and he may ſooner ſend praying packing after.</p>
                     <p>But here in vaine man fighteth with his own ſhadow making Preaching an enemy to Prayer, which never had the leaſt jarre or quarrel one with the other, but what he maketh, or imagineth. He deſireth Prayer without Preaching; not that preaching would juſtle out prayer; but, becauſe he fancieth that ſome men plead for preaching without prayer; which none that truly knew either, ever did. Only they would have both to go hand in hand, which goes to his heart.</p>
                     <p>Prayer, if ſpiritually performed, is as great an enemy to the carnal heart as preaching, yet he liketh prayer better, becauſe in praying he hath the matter in his own hand and power, both for matter, words and time: eſpecially if a ſet-form be uſed, or if he be the mouth of the company. But let him that ſeeks thus to ſever theſe duties that God hath ſo wiſely joyned, read his ſentence from Gods own mouth; <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be abominable</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, prayer is a ſpender, the Word is a nouriſher. While a man prayeth, he layeth out his ſoule and ſpirits at the Market to buy food; the Word in the mean time ſupports and feeds him till he hath made his market, and brought home what he went for; <hi>man lives not by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God</hi>

He muſt ſtill keep cloſe to the Word till he attaine that which the Word directed him to pray for, not only as his warrant, but as his life.

                        <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 23.14</note>. This hypocrite hath ever ſome wickedneſſe in his eye; when he is more then ordinarily buſie at his prayers. The Papiſt ſeemes devoutly charitable to ſet a rich man out of Purgatory, but it is to cheat the heire of a good part of his eſtate under colour of praying for his fathers ſoul. This hypocrite prayeth, but it is the better to cover ſome boſome-luſt, ſome ſecret way of ſinning that he would fain hide by ſpreading this ſpecious veile over it; in hope that however ſome men may talk their pleaſure of him, yet no good man that converſeth with him, and heares him pray, will ever believe what others charge him with.</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian by prayer growes into more hatred of ſinne,</hi>

                     <p>And as it is a curb from evil, ſo it gives ſtrength to the ſoul againſt it. Prayer is a main peece of the ſpiritual Armour<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 6.18</note>. Yea it is <gap reason="foreign">

This is that weapon which he muſt not only brandiſh, but uſe to purpoſe, to kill and ſlay all thoſe luſts that war in his members and fight againſt his ſoul, even when he hath put on the whole Armour of God. It is that which makes him ſtrong not only againſt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but even to wreſtle with God himſelf, as <hi>Jacob</hi> with the Angel, and to prevaile with him<note n="b" place="margin">Hoſ. 12.3</note>, although not againſt him.</p>
                     <p>A Chriſtian having prayed in the morning, is both ſtronger every way in himſelf, and better guarded by God and Angels all the day after, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was in his greateſt feares. Prayer binds the hands of blood-thirſty-men, as once it did <hi>the mouth of the Lions</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown into the Den amongſt them<note n="c" place="margin">Dan 6.20</note>, it is the key of the day to open the door of grace and bleſſings unto him: and it is the lock or bolt of the night that ſhuts him in ſafe from the dangers and terrours of the dark.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite maketh uſe of devotion to cover, or countenance iniquity; the true Chriſtian emproveth his prayers to be rid of all evil. The one <hi>prayeth,</hi> and <hi>fasteth</hi> too, <hi>for ſtrife and debate and to fight with the fift of wickedneſſe</hi>

                     <p>He loves it as an Ordinance of God, as well as a meanes of bleſſing to himſelf. He findes ſweetneſſe in the duty, as well as in the ſucceſſe: as it brings him into the preſence of his God whom his ſoul loveth, as well as it drawes down bleſſings from God as a fruit of his love: as it drawes down ſpiritual bleſſings, as well as things of this life, Yea there are many things in prayer beſide the bringing in the hypocrites God, <hi>Mammon.</hi> It <hi>ſanctifieth</hi> every <hi>bleſſing</hi> to a Chriſtian as well as procures it for him<note n="h" place="margin">1 Tim 4.5</note>.</p>

It was the ſweeteſt water that ever <hi>Sampſon</hi> drank of, out of the Jaw-bone of an Aſſe, which he got by prayer; and for which he named it <hi>En-hakkore, the Well of him that prayed</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Judg 15.19</note>. He that prayeth not, cannot ſee Gods goodneſſe in any thing. Therefore the Chriſtian prayeth that he may ſee it in every thing, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did in the countenance of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 33.10</note>. To him that converſeth with God by prayer, a letter, or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63232:140"/> or ſome ſleighter accident many times caſteth in greater comforts into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then great wind-falls to them that live <hi>without God in the world.</hi> To the one, great matters come ſhort of ſatisfaction, to the other ordinary benefits exceed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: becauſe the one lookes for comfort in the gift, the other is ſwallowed up in the boundleſſe mercy and bounty of the Giver: eſpecially compared with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe of the receiver. Nothing can be accounted ſmall that comes from ſo great love, and is beſtowed on ſo mean deſert.</p>
                     <p>Prayer is that which not only ſweetens mercy, but nouriſheth faith and hope in God of farther and greater bleſſings, making the receit of one, a pledge and pawn of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, wilt not thou not deliver my feet from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 56.13</note>? He being and proclaiming himſelf to be <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> this cannot but encourage all <hi>fleſh to come</hi> unto <hi>him</hi>

                     <p>It encourageth him to the labours of his calling, becauſe prayer addeth to the ſtrength of the labourer as well as to the iſſue of his labour, which it crowneth with ſucceſſe; and where the labour endeth, the ſucceſſe beginneth: ſo that prayer is a <hi>Coadjutor</hi> in his labours, and an Inſurancer of his profit. It not only makes the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light, but the gaines heavy, if not alwayes in the purſe, yet in the heart. By this meanes, <hi>the bleſſing of God maketh rich,</hi> and <hi>he addes no ſorrow with it</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 10.22</note>: not that a rich man (although an holy man) hath no ſorrow: for, who more?

His riches have no thornes in them, although men may caſt him upon a bed of thornes for them.</p>
                     <p>It maketh him more in love with God, when he hath ſo much experience of the goodneſſe, bounty, fidelity of God, in hearing prayer. Every return of prayer is a new love-token from heaven that raiſeth the heart of the receiver unto heaven; Therefore he concludeth that he can no more live without prayer, then he can live without God, his prayer is his breath: without breathing, the body would be enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the heat of his own entralls; ſo without this breathing of prayer, the ſoule would ſoon <hi>wax ſo hot,</hi> as to ſet all on <hi>fire within him</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 39.3.</note>. He hath no help againſt it, but to ſpeak unto God in prayer. He meetes with much evil in the world, where ſhould he take Sanctuary? where ſhould he poure out his complaints? but into Gods boſome. To what ſhelter ſhould he retire, but only to God? and how to him, but by prayer? this is that which ſecures him, not only from the world, but his own evil heart; and brings him not only into the Court of heaven, but to the throne of grace, the fountain of light and life.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is a <hi>fool that hath a price in his hand to get wiſdome,</hi> and all other treaſures of heaven, <hi>but he hath no heart unto it.</hi> The true Chriſtian is as the skilful <hi>Chymist,</hi> that can extract all good things out of that one body of prayer.

                     <p>The graces which are in an hypocrite are true, for kind, they are merited by the blood of Chriſt, wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt: but they are not of the ſame kind with thoſe in the Chriſtian that do accompany ſalvation. He may have the ſame light, the ſame ſight, ſo farre as to behold the things of God, as in glaſſe, but not as in his heart. Dimly, but not clearely; for conviction, not ſalvation, for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not of himſelf. If he pretend to more, he counterſeiteth; there, <hi>he hath not the Spirit</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Jud. 19.</note>; not the Spirit to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> him, for <hi>he is not purged from his filthineſs,</hi> how <hi>pure</hi> ſoever he he <hi>in his own eyes</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite may ſee much, but enjoyeth nothing, of what he ſeeth: the true Chriſtian enjoyeth more than he is able at all times to diſcern: The one <hi>taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> often of Chriſt and his Word, but never makes meale upon either, and ſo thrives not; the other <hi>taſteth</hi> ſo as to deſire both, as a child the breaſt<note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.3.</note>, and <hi>is nouriſhed up in the words of faith</hi>

If all hypocrites were taken away, the Church would ſeem to appeare as were too neer ſhorne, and pared. It will make her outwardly more naked and weak; but yet, not maymed, or lame; he is as the teeth that chew meat for the ſtomack, but not to taſte the meat themſelves: as the fat that ſtuffes out the body, but ſtrengthens it not; The Church by ſuch adherents, looks fat and fair, but is never the ſtronger: they adde to her plight, but not to her might.

                     </p>
                     <p>A ſpirit that none but himſelfe and thoſe of his way ever attained. A ſpirit that moves him to do things not onely beſide the Word, but contrary to it, like thoſe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets or dreamers of dreames,</hi> to draw men to <hi>go after other Gods</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 13.1</note>. A common thing with thoſe that tell lies, in Gods name, to ſay, <hi>I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Jer. 23.25.</note>. Thus, the prophets of <hi>Ahab</hi> had a ſpirit by themſelves to prophecy what might pleaſe their Maſter<note n="n" place="margin">1 Kin. 22.13</note>, how much ſo ever diſpleaſing unto God. And if <hi>Micaiah</hi> prophecy otherwiſe, it muſt be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Spirit of the Lord was gone out of Zedekiah to ſpeake to Micaiah</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">ver. 24.</note>. which muſt not be admitted, eſpecially in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, and to <hi>Ahabs</hi> face. Yet, this was not the Spirit of the Lord that prophecyed ſo much good to <hi>Ahab,</hi> but another <hi>ſpirit came and ſtood before the Lord;</hi> a <hi>lying ſpirit in the mouth of all thoſe prophets</hi>

                     <p>And even in the Goſpel there is a <hi>Caveat</hi> given <hi>not to believe every ſpirit</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1</note> there are more lying ſpirits than true, not only without the pales of the Church, but within it. The <hi>Spirit of truth</hi> is but one, <hi>whom the world cannot receive</hi> ſo, as to caſt off lying ſpirits that prophecy of wine, and ſtrong drink, of gain and wealth, of pride and luſt. This hypocrite is never without aſpirit to move him to any filthineſſe or wickedneſſe; how unnatural and horrid ſoever. The laſt age, and this ſwarme with ſuch <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> as never find any motions of the Spirit, ſo prevalent with them, ſo magnified by them, ſo confidently aſſerted before all, as when they <hi>walk after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſs, &amp; deſpiſe Government,</hi> when they are moſt <hi>preſumptious, and ſelfwil'd</hi> and <hi>not afraid to ſpeake evil of dignities</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">2 Pet 2.10.</note>. Tell this hypocrite of a word forbidding &amp; condemning his practice, he ſleights both you &amp; it, and tels you back a taile of the ſpirit which is and will be his warrant againſt all gain-ſayes. And no marvel: for he that deſpiſeth the Word, the breath of the Spirit, muſt needs betake him to another Spirit, as <hi>Ahabs</hi> prophets did, to juſtifie that contempt.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian admits of no Spirit but that which goes along with the Word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He remembreth that the promiſe of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>the Word,</hi> is that they ſhall go together; not for a time only, but even for ever in the moſt glorious dayes of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical light. It is that God hath covenanted with his people to beſtow upon them<note n="u" place="margin">Iſay. 59.21</note>. <hi>My Spirit that is upon thee and the words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord from henceforth &amp; for ever.</hi> Where the promiſe runs mainly upon <hi>the Word in the mouth</hi> give to notice to all that the Spirit of God moves the mouth to nothing elſe. He forgets not that aſſertion of his Lord, <hi>It is eaſier for heaven and earth to paſſe, then one tittle of the Law to faile</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Luk. 16.17</note>: and that he is commanded to <hi>try the Spirit whether they be of God</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1</note>. And the rule of trial given him by God himſelf is this. <hi>To the Law and to the teſtimonies; if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them to</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrite may have the ſpirit of bondage, but not of adoption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſpirit of bondage is an operation of the Holy Ghoſt by the Law, convincing the conſcience of ſinne, terrifying it with the threats of the Law, and making a man to be loſt in his own judgement and feeling, and imprinting in him ſuch an apprehenſion
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63232:143"/> and ſenſe of the wrath of God, as makes the very remembrance of God to be a terror to him; His <hi>terrors ſet themſelves in array</hi> againſt him<note n="a" place="margin">Job. 6.4.</note>. <hi>He taketh him by the neck, and ſhakes him to peeces, and ſets him up for his mark</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 30.14.</note>.</p>
                     <p>This ſpirit of bondage may ſometimes be, and is without ſaving grace; making not only <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> but the <hi>Devils themſelves to trimble</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Jam. 2.19.</note>, and endeth in deſpair: for it breeds ſuch a feare in this hypocrite, as in reprobates, that makes him to conclude againſt all poſſibility of mercy, or careleſſe of the meanes of recovery.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian hath the ſpirit of bondage,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>as a fore-runner of the Spirit of adoption.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He may have ſuch a ſpirit upon him, as may for a ſeaſon terrify him to purpoſe, but it continueth not. This rod prepared for the wicked, ſhall not alwayes remaine upon his back. <hi>He hath not received the Spirit of bondage to feare againe, but the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8.15</note>. It is a ſtep towards ſaving grace, and an in let to ſaving comforts. It makes him feare; but, to quicken his diligence to look out and purſue all means of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, thereby to prevent the thing feared. Thus they who <hi>were pricked</hi> to or <hi>in their hearts,</hi> preſently cry out, <hi>men and brethren what ſhall we do</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 2.37</note>? that is, <hi>to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 16.30.</note>. And ſo, <hi>he worketh out his ſalvation with feare and trembling</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note>: not as doubting the iſſue: for then, in vaine to bid him work; but, as hoping for ſucceſſe, and therefore his <hi>feare</hi> in working, is from vigilancy not from deſpaire; as fearing he ſhould omit any thing neceſſary, not as ſuſpecting he ſhould come ſhort of ſalvation, when he hath done his outmoſt to work it out.</p>
                     <p>This feare is as the needle that makes way for the thread, as phyſick that makes men ſick in order to health. And as privation is reckoned among the principles of generation, as <hi>cauſa fine qui non,</hi> becauſe till the old forme be removed, there can be no roome for a new. So the ſpirit of bondage by bondage prepareth for the Spirit of adoption, that <hi>we receive the adoption of Sonnes</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note>. And ſo, by enmity way is made to attonement; by feare, to love and aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>There is no child of God but hath had ſome experience of that work of the Spirit, although the degrees and ſymptoms be not in all alike, But no hypocrite ever had or ſhall bave any part in the Spirit, or grace of Adoption, which Chriſt deriveth only to <hi>Sonnes</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 4.6.</note>. The <hi>Spirit of adoption</hi> is nothing elſe but the powerful and ſweet ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghoſt, revealing and aſſuring to a true Chriſtian that he is Gods childe and enabling to believe, <hi>and cry Abba father.</hi> Which becauſe it is of great comfort and uſe, I ſhall further give you the ſeveral differences between the true child of God and the hypocrite, in point of adoption, in ſeveral characters next enſuing, wherein the hypocrite comes ſhort of the Chriſtian in four acts of the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are, <hi>witneſſing, ſealing, comforting, and crying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is ſurprized by the ſpirit of bondage, as <hi>Agag by Samuel;</hi> and ſo is hewen to peeces<note n="m" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.32 33.</note>, even where he expected quarter. The true Chriſtian is as <hi>Hagar,</hi> that at firſt ſeeing nothing but preſent death to her ſelfe and her ſon, for want of water, hath afterwards her eyes opened, and God ſheweth her a Well to the ſatisfaction and preſervation of both<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 21.19.</note>: the one is haunted, to his deſtruction; the other is ſcared to his reſcue and deliverence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite hath no witneſſe of his adoption, but his own ſpirit.</hi>

                        <hi>Quod volumus facilè credimus.</hi> We are willing to believe what we have a mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And to be eaſily perſwaded, we ſhall have what we long to enjoy. Every man is a ſelf-flatterer, &amp; willing to be lul'd aſleep with ſelf-deceiving, as he that plays by himſelf, wins all, yet in the iſſue gets nothing: Thus is it with this hypocrite. He gives out that he is Gods childe, takes the name and title upon him, even to God himſelfe: <hi>wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, my father</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Jer. 3.4,</note>? But who ſhall witneſſe that he is not a <hi>child of fornication,</hi> a baſtard laid at Gods door? Himſelf, for, none elſe will. He ſaith it, therefore you muſt believe him: For he knoweth, you cannot prove the contrary by any judgment paſſed on his heart which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63232:144"/> God alone ſearcheth. And if you will take upon you; he will ask you from God, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Rom, 14.14</note>? And thus, when he hath ſtop't your mouth, he never takes further care to make out his title unto God.</p>
                     <p>But if Chriſt himſelf, who is truth it ſelf, be content to put himſelf into the rank of common men in witneſſe-bearing, and ingenuouſly confeſſe, <hi>If I bear witneſſe of my ſelf, my witneſſe is not true</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">John 5.31.</note>: that is, not ſufficient to ſatisfie a Judge or Jury in a judicial way for clearing up a doubt to thoſe that make the doubt, albeit in truth and indeed, as to point of conſcience, Chriſt might ſay, as at another time he did, <hi>though I bare record of my ſelf, yet my record is true, becauſe I know whence I came, and whether I go</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">John 8.14.</note>. Where then ſhall the hypocrite appear, and who ſhall give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his own ſingle teſtimony of himſelf alone?</p>
                     <p>For albeit he herein ſtrikes in with ſome Anabaptiſts, and others of like ſtrain, that pretend to the Spirit, yet it will never be made out to be any other ſpirit but his own, as may thus appear.</p>
                     <p>Where the Spirit of God <hi>witneſſeth,</hi> he doth it not by immediate revelation, with out, and beſide the Word, but by and upon the evidence that may be made to any rational man out of the Word it ſelf: firſt, giving the rule of trial. The <hi>Spirit</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is <hi>received by the hearing of faith</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Gal. 3.2.</note>, that is, the <hi>Word of faith.</hi> Becauſe the Word both teſtifieth of him, and conveyeth him to the believer. How then can the Spirit of God witneſſe without the Word, that cannot be in the heart without the Word? The Spirit of God ſpake by me, ſaith <hi>David:</hi> and what did he ſpeak: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gods Word; <hi>his Word was in my mouth</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">2 Sam. 23.2.</note>. The Spirit cannot ſpeak a word, but the Word of God, either as the rule of trial, or warrant for application: as the rule; thus, he that believeth is Gods child; for, <hi>to as many as believe, to them he gives power to be become the ſonnes of God</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">John 11.2.</note>. But thou doſt believe ſaith the Spirit; for thy <hi>faith</hi> is ſuch as <hi>purifies thy heart</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Acts 15.9</note>, and <hi>worketh by love</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 5, 6.</note>. Therefore I am witneſſe with thee, even to God himſelf that thou art the child of God. Can the hypocrite find the Holy Ghoſt bearing him witneſſe that he ſo believeth? that his faith <hi>purgeth him from his filthineſſe,</hi> in the ſight of God, or that it <hi>workes by love</hi> in the ſight of men? where then is his witneſſe?</p>
                     <p>Again, where the Spirit witneſſeth from the Word, the Spirit worketh in man what the Word requireth of him; the Word requireth him to <hi>repent and believe the Goſpel</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Mark 1.15.</note> Now, the Spirit of Chriſt, is a Spirit, of <hi>ſupplication</hi> or <hi>lamentation</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelf</hi> (<note n="e" place="margin">1 John 5.10.</note>: not only to be himſelf a witneſſe, but as having in him the Spirit of God that wrought that faith to witneſſe with him. And, whereas the Word ſetteth down, firſt a general promiſe, <hi>he that believeth</hi> in Chriſt <hi>ſhall he ſaved</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mark 16.16. Act. 16.31.</note>; and then gives an univerſal command, ſo to do, <hi>look upon me all ye ends of the earth and be ye ſaved</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 45.22.</note>. And thereupon the Spirit of Chriſt, that <hi>worketh all our workes in us,</hi> thus proceedes to witneſſe; Firſt, illightning him, ſo, as to ſee the truth of the Word, ſo as to be able to ſay by his light, <hi>that Jeſus is the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3</note>; ſo that there is in him, a concurrence of the Spirit, even to Hiſtorical faith, or to faith of aſſent. Then, he affecteth the Chriſtian ſo, as to deſire, long, and thirſt after a ſhare in Chriſt; not only as <hi>Balaam,</hi> whoſe mouth watered at the happineſſe of Gods people, yet it was but as a ſupper-thirſt, quenched with atale, or any other diverſion; but the Chriſtian is in good earneſt, he panteth after God, <hi>as the Hart panteth after the water-brookes (i).</hi> He muſt have it, or die for thirſt, as <hi>Iſhmael (k).</hi> After this, the Spirit worketh (as before was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the conditions and tokens of ſalvation deſcribed in the Word. For, God by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63232:144"/> his Spirit giveth both faith and repentance, by which the Chriſtian comes to have, a ſpirit of his own to witneſſe for him with the Spirit of God. Then, the Spirit ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his eyes to ſee the work of the Spirit, and the truth of grace in him. And for this end he <hi>receiveth the Spirit which is of God, whereby he knoweth the things which are truly given him of God</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12</note>. He that believeth perceiveth himſelf to believe, the Spirit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabling him to ſee and feel it. Not that the Chriſtian alwayes ſeeth this, even when it is plain enough to be ſeen. In times of relapſes, tentations, and ſpiritual deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is otherwiſe with him: but when ever he doth ſee theſe, it is the Spirit of God that ſhewes them to him. Yea, the ſame Spirit helpeth him to uſe and improve natural reaſon in this ſpiritual Argumentation, and from undeniable evidences and premiſes to conclude himſelf to be a ſon of God. For, in tentations, and ſpiritual conflicts of conſcience, the ſpirit of a man hath not power of himſelf to conclude, be the premiſes never ſo plain, unleſſe it be aſſiſted, and as it were, actuated by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like the Jewes labouring to ſuborne falſe witneſſes to ſerve their turnes, how void of truth ſoever. The true Chriſtian is careful that by <hi>the mouthes of two</hi> witneſſes at leaſt, by Gods Spirit and his own, every word touching his own eſtate, ſhould <hi>be eſtabliſhed:</hi> the one would have a lying Spirit, like that againſt <hi>Naboth</hi> to be taken for a witneſſe to a ly; the other is altogether for the Spirit of truth, <hi>who is truth and is noly</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 John 2.27</note>, to bear witneſſe with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrites confidence of the Spirit of Adoption is from a bare Writing, without a <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>He is confident even unto impudence, that he hath an undoubted title to whatever the Spirit worketh, becauſe he findeth in himſelf ſome work of the Spirit: which is, as if a beggar, having a few braſſe tokens in his purſe, ſhould conclude thence that he hath right to all the gold in the Mint; or, as if a ſervant ſhould inferre, that, becauſe he finds the Maſter of the houſe to provide bread for him as well as for the heire, therefore he hath as good right to the inheritance as the heire; and, that <hi>Eliezer</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſhould be <hi>Abrahams heire,</hi> becauſe <hi>born in his houſe,</hi> although he <hi>came not out of Abrahams loines</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 15.2, 3</note>. But, to undeceive this hypocrite; or, at leaſt others, concerning him; It is to be conſidered that there are two workes, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Spirit, both which he worketh, where he is a Spirit of Adoption; the one is <hi>Writing,</hi> the other is <hi>ſealing.</hi> He <hi>writeth,</hi> firſt in the mind, by illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eyes of the underſtanding, opening that, whereby the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is made known to the mind. And this cannot be denied to the hypocrite, at leaſt in part, whereby he ſeeth ſomewhat of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, as he that being before blind, by the <hi>firſt touch of</hi> his eyes by Chriſt, <hi>ſaw men walking like trees</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Mark 8.23, 24</note>, as <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw Chriſt <hi>from the top of the rocks,</hi> and beheld <hi>him from the Hills</hi>

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 6.4</note>; but, as Chriſt <hi>touched that blind man a ſecond time, and made him to look up,</hi> and then <hi>he was reſtored. and ſaw every man clearely</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Mark 8.25</note>, ſo the Spirit of God writeth a ſecond line in the Chriſtian, and that is, <hi>written upon his heart</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 10.16</note>; whereby he is now <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Chriſt, written, not with inke, hut with the Spirit of the Living God, not in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the heart</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3</note>. The hypocrite never had ſuch a writing upon his heart, which is a <hi>Table of stone,</hi> and that of <hi>Adamant,</hi> made ſo by himſelf, on purpoſe, leaſt <hi>he ſhould heare the Law, and the words which the Lord hath ſent in his Spirit by the Prophets</hi>

                     <p>The other impreſſion of this ſpirit, is <hi>ſealing.</hi> And the uſe of this is to appropriate, confirme, and ratifie to the believer what ever is contained in the Promiſe, as the ſeale is commonly uſed to confirme what is granted in a writing of Indenture.

                        <note n="w" place="margin">Rom. 4.11</note>; which is then ratified when there is <hi>a ſtipulation,</hi> or <hi>anſwer of a good ſeal</hi> of <hi>conſcience unto God</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 21</note>, and the Covenant kept on mans part.

                        <hi>in water face anſwereth to face,</hi> and as the print in the wax anſwereth to the ſeale ſet upon it, ſo here is even <hi>grace for grace</hi> appearing in the Chriſtian thus ſealed. Unto this, the hypocrite never comes: for this belongeth only to thoſe that are truly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and effectually waſhed in the blood of Chriſt: as will by and by appeare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian hath the ſeale as well as the Writing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath not only the <hi>Law written in his heart,</hi> whereby he anſwereth and reſembleth God, but he hath a confirmation of all that God hath promiſed to him in whom he hath ſo written, whereby this <hi>heire of Promiſe</hi> may be aſſured of <hi>the immutability of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> concerning him, and <hi>have ſtrong conſolation,</hi> having thus <hi>fled to God for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before him</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 6.18</note>. For, he is now ſealed up as Gods own goods, and Gods mercies in Chriſt are all ſealed up unto him as his own undoubted treaſure. A ſeal that is never ſet on before ſaving faith be wrought in the heart, and ſets it ſelf on work to believe and reſt upon the Promiſes of the Goſpel; as the Apoſtle tells the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Epheſians, <hi>In whom after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that Holy Spirit of Promiſe</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.13</note>. And when this ſeale is once ſet on, it is never torn off again, untill all be accompliſhed that was by this ſeal confirmed to him: for, he is <hi>ſealed to the day of Redemption</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 4.30</note>, with this inſcription, <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> on the one ſide of the ſeale; and, with this on the other, <hi>let every one that calleth on the Name of the Lord, depart from iniquity</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19</note>.</p>
                     <p>This ſeale is not only a confirmation of what ſhall be, but <hi>an earneſt of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance untill the Redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.14</note>. God gives his Spirit as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, as ſomething in hand, untill more come; not as a pledge or pawn to lie for a time in his hand, and afterwards to be taken home again from the Chriſtian, but as a part of the main inheritance never to be redeemed or taken back. Therefore is the Spirit called an <hi>earneſt,</hi> and <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> to aſſure us of more to follow; here the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite muſt hand off. A taſte, or a ſay he may have, as many have, that bargain not. But the <hi>earneſt,</hi> which argueth a plain bargain, is peculiar only to the believer truly regenerated.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſhewes up and down a Writing, and that not truly ingroſſed neither, but never had the ſeale of the Spirit to confirme it: the true believer layes claime to nothing without producing the ſeale to the Writing perfectly ingroſſed: the one produceth either a Counterfeit, or at leaſt imperfect ſeale, a <hi>ſeale manual,</hi> as that of Baptiſme; the other ſhewes the great ſeal, the Spirit of Adoption. The one ſhewes a ſeal, but without livery and ſeiſin; the other hath livery and ſeiſin given, ſo ſoon as the Writing was ſealed; the one pleades a grant, but all is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the other hath preſent poſſeſſion in part conferred on him.</p>

                     <p>He is over-joyed and tranſported with comfort upon the firſt receiving of the glad-tidings of the Goſpel, as the <hi>ſtony ground,</hi> that firſt <hi>receives the Word with joy</hi>

                     <p>He is bold in running upon comforts, before he ſee or underſtand what they be, or upon what termes to be had.

                     <p>True comfort flowes from a fountaine and abundance of grace; not from a pittance, much leſſe from a bare ſhow and ſhadow of that in which the comfort is pretened to be taken.

                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian liveth,</hi>

                        <note n="i" place="margin">Iſay 66.11</note>. <hi>He knoweth the Comforter,</hi> for <hi>he dwelleth in him, and ſhall be in him</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">John 14.17.</note>. He hath <hi>everlaſting conſolation and good hope through grace</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.16</note>. This comfort hath two properties that make it differ <hi>toto coelo,</hi> as farre as the Eaſt from the Weſt, from all the comforts of the hypocrite.</p>
                     <p>True comfort is ſo apprehended by the Chriſtian, that he <hi>thrivs,</hi> and <hi>grows</hi> by it, not only in joy, but in holineſſe. The Church that <hi>walked in the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> had <hi>the feare of God</hi> joyned with it, and <hi>were edified</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 9.31.</note> thereby. This effect is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the people of God receiving of the comforts of the Church of old, <hi>when ye ſee this, your heart ſhall rejoyce;</hi> with what manner of rejoycing? with that wich will make them to be like the herbs and plants by the influence of the Sunne in the ſpring, <hi>your bones ſhall flouriſh like the herb</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Iſay 66.14</note>. No herb grows faſter by the heat of the Sunne, than a Chriſtian by his comforts. Wereas the hypocrite by falſe apprehenſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, never groweth by them, even when he ſeemeth to be fulleſt of them: Rather they make him idle and ſecure, and ſo he grows worſe, not better by his conſolations, as <hi>Herod,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>gladneſſe</hi> in <hi>hearing of John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another inſeparable property of true comfort is, that it gives <hi>a joy that none ſhall take away</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">John 16.22.</note>. Not that the actual ſhining of comforts by the Holy Ghoſt, admits of no intermiſſions, and interpoſitions of darker waether. Nothing more frequent, in thoſe eſpecially that are prone to relapſes, than to be under clouds of ſadneſſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of terror, to the <hi>breaking of the bones</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 51.8.38 3.</note> of all true comforts and joy. But, the <hi>Spirit of Comfort</hi> is never taken from him; therefore the ground of comfort continueth, when the act is intermitted; yea, the comforts once given out, are a ſtock ſufficient to live upon till new comforts come. Even he that is ſo far from preſent comfort, that the <hi>very remembrance of God</hi> that was his Comforter, is now a <hi>trouble</hi> to him, in ſo much as his <hi>ſoul refuſeth to be comforted</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 77.2, 3</note>. Yet even then, in the cloſe, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his refuſing of comfort, and ſad apprehenſions of God, was but <hi>his infirmity,</hi> and therefore comforteth himſelf in <hi>remembring the years of the right hand of the moſt High</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">ver. 10.</note>, wherein the power and goodneſſe of God poured comforts into his ſoul, which in <hi>the multitude of his</hi> amazing <hi>thoughts within him, refreſh his ſoule</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 94.19</note>. Whereas the comforts of the hypocrites are like the <hi>crackling of thornes under a pot,</hi> as ſoon extinct as kindled, like a flaſh of lightning, as ſoon gone as come; after which, the remembrance of former felicity now adds to his miſery, his former comforts are now ready to thruſt him over head and ears into deeper grief and more deſperate ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this Hypocrite is but a pretender to comfort, without true conſolation; the true Chriſtian only enjoys it as his portion, and as being the better for it. The comforts of the one are like the <hi>lips of a ſtrange woman, which drop as an honey-comb,</hi> but <hi>her end is bitter as wormwood</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Prov. 5.3, 4</note>; the comforts of the other are like the ſtreames of <hi>Jordan</hi> to <hi>Naaman,</hi> cauſing <hi>his fleſh to come</hi> freſh <hi>againe; as the fleſh of a little child</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">2 King. 5.14</note>. To the one comforts are like <hi>ſtrong drink, bitter to them that drink it</hi>

The Spirit it may be in him to reſtraine and repreſſe ſome corruptions, that, might they be ſuffered, would prove too miſchievous to others, as well as to himſelf; but not to renue and regenerate him: to over-rule him, but not to new make him.

                     <p>Chriſt knocketh at his door, as well by his Spirit, as by his Word, but he opens

Yea, the Holy Ghoſt, may breake open the door and come in: How elſe can he be ſaid to <hi>grieve,</hi> and <hi>quench him?</hi> Therefore it is granted that as he is in all men, as God in the creature, to ſuſtain him; in all within the Church, as a light, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them; in all of eminent parts, to furniſh them; ſo he is often in the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that hath any good motions, to ſuggeſt, and ſecond them, which motions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or ſtifle, and ſo grieve and reſiſt him.</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is in the true Chriſtian, not only to ſuggeſt and propound,</hi>

                     <p>The Holy Ghoſt enters the Chriſtian to all intents and purpoſes. To illighten, to direct, to guide him in the right way to work grace, as a workman in his ſhop,<note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 143.10</note> that is never idle.

                     <p>The Holy Ghoſt is in a Chriſtian as graffing in him the Word of life to bring forth fruit unto life, cauſing the graff or ſyen to alter the very nature of the ſtock, the heart on which he engraffeth. He not only worketh in him but is himſelf there to cheriſh and perfect the work. He not only worketh love, but ſheds abroad Gods love in his heart: not only faith, repentance, prayer, &amp;c. are graffed on the ſtock, but himſelf lies at the root, to give it life, nouriſhment, and growth, cauſing him ſtill to go forward unto perfection.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the hypocrite, if the Holy Ghoſt come neere him, will entertain him no better than the Sodomites did the Angels, even forcing the Holy Spirit of God, if he can, to ſerve his baſe luſts<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 19.5</note>; or, as the leud Gibeonites did the Levites concubine, abuſing her even unto death<note n="b" place="margin">Judg. 19.25</note>; the true Chriſtian entertaines the Holy Ghoſt as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did the <hi>Angels</hi> that came unto them, with all ſervice and honour<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 18.2 Gen. 19.1, 2</note>.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>AITH is the <hi>primum vivens,</hi> the firſt thing that lives in a Chriſtian, as ſuch. And as the natural heat is the general inſtrument of the reaſonable ſoul to faſhion and adorne her houſe of the body; ſo is faith the general inſtrument of the Spirit, to faſhion and reforme every part of the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now, it may be thought, that of all graces, Faith is moſt peculiar to the truly regenerate; and leaſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any other; for the Apoſtle, not only ſaith, <hi>all men have not faith</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.2</note>: but calls this grace, <hi>the faith of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 1.1</note>, as belonging to none but thoſe of that Corporation. And it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth that true ſaving faith which juſtifieth and ſaveth, is no where found but- in them that are truly and actually regenerated.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding, for as much as <hi>Temporaries</hi> are ſaid to <hi>believe for awhile</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 8.13</note>; that he <hi>taſteth of the heavenly gift</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 6.4</note> (and what more <hi>heavenly</hi> then faith, that gives heaven upon earth, that is, <hi>peace with God,</hi> and unites unto Chriſt; who is the way for our poore earth to aſcend from earth to heaven?) and, that it is ſaid that many <hi>beleeved on Chriſt,</hi> upon ſight of his <hi>miracles,</hi> to whom he <hi>would not commit himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 2, 23.24</note>; that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> alſo <hi>believed</hi>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">James 2.19</note>; it cannot be wholly denied that hypocrites (who are indeed Infidels, as to ſaving believing) do after a ſort believe. Not only as ſeeming to others, even to Gods dear children who cannot judge of the heart, (as <hi>Simon,</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi>) in the judgment of charity and probability, to partake of faith: but, even to themſelves, in the judgment of partiality, to believe. For as they delude others, by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conformity in profeſſion, ſo they moſt of all, and moſt dangerouſly deceive themſelves by ſome of thoſe hand-maids which accompany ſaving faith as well as theirs.</p>
                     <p>For this hypocrite doth not lay a falſe ground as the Worldling doth, <hi>He that hath worldly wealth is in Gods favour;</hi> but, his ground is true enough, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But his errour is in the Aſſumption or application, when he aſſumeth, or rather preſumeth, <hi>But I believe on the Son of God.</hi> Herein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men may be abuſed, who judge both according to the outward profeſſion they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63232:148"/> ſee in him, and the charity they have in themſelves towards others; and himſelf alſo may be much more deluded, he being moſt willing in his own behalf to be deceived. Only Chriſt, who knoweth all men, and <hi>what is in man</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">John 2.24, 25</note>; and, <hi>from the beginning</hi> ſeeth <hi>who they are that believe not</hi>

                     <p>But becauſe it concerneth every man to know his own eſtate, and not to hood-wink himſelf through wilful blindneſſe, in a buſineſſe of ſuch high concernment; untill Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan come at the houre of death, and make him, not only by cleare conviction of his judgment and conſcience, but by woful and inevitable experience, to ſee and find himſelf to be his prey; and, to the end the common deluſion whereby every man is apt to be overtaken and ruined, thinking and preſuming that he hath faith, and hath believed in God ever ſince he could remember, prove not his everlaſting confuſion; It will be good, yea neceſſary, for every one to conſider what Chriſt ſometimes ſaid to ſuch ſelf-deceivers, that followed him with others for the preſent, and thought as well of their own faith as any in the company, <hi>there are ſome of you that believe not</hi>

                        <note n="o" place="margin">John 6.71</note>. Such even while they believe are Infidels. They be not the men they take themſelves to be, they do not the thing which they ſuppoſe they do, as ſhall anon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

                     <p>The true Believer hath his non-age of faith; and, his diſeaſes too, by lapſes into ſin; and, his weakenings of it, by tentations; in all, which he is in great ſtraites, feares and perplexities. In the <hi>non-age</hi> of his faith, even while he <hi>believeth</hi> weakly, (yet ſo well as he can,) he cries out, <hi>Lord help my unbelief</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Mark 9, 24</note>. I confeſſe I have much infidelity in me, more infidelity then faith, Lord cure me of this: <hi>help my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;</hi> that is, eaſe, and rid me of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> by their great falls, gave great wounds to their faith, inſomuch that they aſtonied it, that it was not able to move, nor breath; it lay ſprawling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, ready to yield up the Ghoſt: yet even then, it might be ſaid of their faith as Chriſt of the <hi>Rulers Daughter</hi> whom the father, and all the company conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be <hi>now dead, give place, the maid is not dead, but ſleepeth</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 9.24</note>. Even their faith was not then dead, although caſt into a dead ſleep.</p>
                     <p>I know a <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or ſome other confident Papiſt, or his younger brother the <hi>Arminian,</hi> will, for this, ſerve me, as the Fidlers did Chriſt, even <hi>laugh me to ſcorne,</hi> for ſo affirming<note n="r" place="margin">ibid. ver. 24</note>: but this is no leſſe a truth, for all their laughing. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had ſtill the holy Spirit in him, <hi>untaken from him,</hi> when he was at the worſt of his ſin, and at the loweſt of his ſorrow for it. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſ. 51.1 1</note>. He could never make ſuch a prayer, if the Spirit were wholly departed; for, as yet he had it. And this was the prayer of faith, for he was heard in what he prayed for. And, as for <hi>Peter,</hi> he was fenced and fortified by the <hi>prayer of Chriſt,</hi> who was <hi>heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">John 11.42</note>, and ever ſped at the throne of grace, <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 22.32</note>. It failed in the act, but not in the habit: for albeit it was not ſo ſtrong as to hold out in the High Prieſts hall; yet it was ſo true, that upon the firſt look of Chriſt towards him after his fall, he got up, <hi>went out, and wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">verſe 61.62</note>.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>tentation</hi> may prevaile ſo farre, as to make a Believer to feare, and aske; <hi>wil the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promiſe faile for evermore &amp;c?</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Pſ. 77.7, 8.</note> Yet, after all this, faith (that ſeemes to be dead, when it lies only hid) breakes out, and tells him the truth; that the miſtake is in himſelf. <hi>This is but his own infirmity</hi> ſo to think and ſpeak of God:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63232:149"/> he hath cauſe to judge otherwiſe of God, and would do ſo too, if he would but look back upon Gods former dealing with him, therefore faith doth put him now upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work, and inſtead of complaining of God, to rejoyce and take comfort in him. <hi>I will remember the yeares of the right hand of the Moſt High</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">verſ. 10.</note>: thoſe times wherein God ſpake peace to his ſoule, and aſſured him to be his God for ever. Thus, he had recourſe from feeling to faith, which yet was alive, although ſo deeply raked up under the aſhes of tentation, that he verily thought it had been quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is in the matter of faith, as the wanton <hi>woman living in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 6</note>, <hi>dead while</hi> he liveth; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Eutichus,</hi> ſleeping; and, <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down from the third loft, is taken up dead,</hi> of whom yet it may be ſaid, <hi>trouble not your ſelves, for his life is in him</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 20.9, 10</note>. The one as <hi>Sardis, hath a name that he liveth, but is dead</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 3.1</note>; the other is as <hi>Abel</hi> in another ſenſe, who <hi>being dead, yet ſpeaketh by his faith</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 11, 4</note>. The one deceiveth others, by a vizar of faith; and afterwards himſelf, by a conceit of faith, (being loth to queſtion that which he ſees ſo many others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;) the other firſt undeceiveth himſelf by caſting away that vizar, and labouring after the truth of faith; and then undeceiveth others by the fruits of his faith, whith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were but counterfeit.</p>
                     <p>In giving this hypocrites Characters, I ſhall firſt give thoſe by which he deceives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſhew, and himſelf in conceit; and then thoſe by which he deceiveth, whether it be in the matter of <hi>Aſſents</hi> or of <hi>application,</hi> or of the <hi>inward joyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments</hi> which he apprehendeth in himſelf, as the fruits of that faith to which he is a Pretender.</p>

                        <hi>This Hypocrite is a counterfeit in the Church, that is, a Church hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many counterfeits in the world, and all nought: counterfeit fooles, that have wit, and conceale it, the better to make fools of others: counterfeit cripples that have limbs, &amp; uſe them not, that they may live by loytering; counterfeit tradeſ-men, that either make a ſhew of wealth, &amp; have it not, or pretend loſſes, &amp; need not, that they may gaine either more credit by the one, or pity by the other than they deſerve. But, as it was ſaid of the vertuous woman, that <hi>many daughters have done vertuouſly, but thou excelleſt them all;</hi> ſo may it be on the contrary, of this hypocrite, many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits have done cunningly, and wickedly, but thou exceedeſt them all.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite deceiveth the Church, even of the Elect, whom the Devil himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wholly deceive<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note>, by joyning with them in Church duties. Thus <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> by his walking with others <hi>to the houſe of God in company,</hi> deceived <hi>David;</hi> for, even then, <hi>wickedneſſe was in his dwelling</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſa. 55.14, 15</note>. Thus, the diſciples of Chriſt were deceived in <hi>Judas,</hi> till his wickedneſſe brake out, they thought him to be a believer as well as themſelves; which made <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay, in the name of them all, <hi>we believe and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">John 6.69</note>, when yet Chriſt knew <hi>one of them to be a Devil</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">ver. 70.</note>. So at another time, he ſpeaketh in the behalfe of all, <hi>we have forſaken all and followed thee,</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 19 27</note>, <hi>what ſhall we have?</hi> Thus not only <hi>Philip,</hi> but even the ſame <hi>Peter,</hi> long afterwards was deceived for a while, in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who gave in his name to Chriſt, received the ſeale of baptiſme, &amp; not only joyned, but <hi>continued with Philip,</hi> and the reſt of the Church<note n="i" place="margin">Acts 8.13.</note>, among whom he paſſed for a true Believer, till the nuts were thrown before this ape, the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, of which he hoped to make a good market, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon would have bought that guift at any price; by which he ſhewed himſelf in his colours, and was diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Thus many Church-Papiſts either by diſpenſations, or at leaſt by diſſimulation, for impunity, credit, preferment, (or haply, for worſe and more dangerous ends) appear ſometimes in our Aſſemblies, yet are arrant Romaniſts ſtill in heart. Many Church-Atheiſts (who, as 'tis to be feared, make up the greater number in all Church-Aſſemblies in the world) reſpecting neither God nor his people (no more then the unjuſt Judge when by importunity he did juſtice,) ſeek to delude both; frequenting the Aſſemblies of the Saints, joyning in the exerciſes of prayer, hearing, receiving of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63232:149"/> Sacraments, taking it in ſcorn not to be accounted good Chriſtians and true Proteſtants, yet in their hearts deſpiſe the power of godlineſs wherever they finde it.</p>
                     <p>Such an one will, perhaps, talk of good things, commend the Preacher and (it may be) his Sermon too, profeſſe liking of ſome ſpecial points in it: above all, points of comfort, wherein he ſeemes to claime a great ſhare. And ſuch an one hath his reward, which is, to be well thought of; and made much of for the time, even of the Saints, which is all he lookes for. But what is he the better for all, or any of this? When not only God, but his own heart alſo condemneth him within, all the while; and all men ſhall ſee, and deride him hereafter?</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Believer is one that anſwereth his name.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is what he is reputed. He knoweth that <hi>a good name</hi> is not to be deſpiſed, but <hi>is better then precious ointment</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1</note>. Therefore he is deſirous both to be, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be well thought of among the faithful; yet hating to be well thought of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe; and afraid to be better thought of then there is cauſe; forbearing all boaſtings, and ſhewes, that might <hi>make any man to think of him above that which he is</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.6</note>. Therefore he labours to be, and to find at home, what he is thought to be abroad. Am I accounted a believer? It is enough, ſaith the hypocrite; but, ſaith the faithful Chriſtian, the more cauſe have I to look throughly into my own heart, and make it out to God and my own conſcience that I have faith indeed. For, well he knoweth, that <hi>not he who commendeth himſelf,</hi> or is commended of others, is approved, <hi>but whom the Lord commendeth</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.18</note>. And that, <hi>he is not a Jew who is one outwardly,</hi> whatever ſhew he make of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith; <hi>but, he is a Jew that is one inwardly,</hi> with the heart believing unto righteouſneſſe<note n="*" place="margin">Romanes 10.9</note>, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God</hi>

For faith where it once comes, let it enter in at what part of the ſoule it will, it is like leaven that runneth over the whole heap of meal, it penetrates every part of the ſoule, and not only takes up a roome there, but acteth in it and by it in every act that true faith truly putteth forth.

                     <p>He heareth the Goſpel, and is ſo convinced by his own underſtanding and reaſon; that he cannot but yield unto the apparent evidence of it.

Thus may a Papiſt be ſaid to believe the Scripture, and the matters contained therein; not becauſe God there ſpeaketh, but becauſe the Church ſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: which is not to believe God, but man, and to give Aſſent not to the truth of God upon his own ſingle authority, but to the truths which the Church pleaſeth to acknowledge; upon her own uſurped liberty. And what greater indignity can be put upon God, then not to believe him upon his own word, but upon the credit of a ſurety, too often known to be partial and falſe? Let ſuch an one but be told by that he calls the Church, that God never taught ſuch a truth, <hi>that only faith juſtifieth,</hi> he dares give the lie to God and all the world, that ſhall go about to perſwade him that that is a truth, let the Scripture ſpeak it never ſo clearely. But, tell him of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by workes and inherent righteouſneſſe; you ſhall have him aſſent hereunto even unto obſtinacy. For indeed, in all points delivered by his Church, inſtead of aſſent he bringeth obſtinacy: not that he is perſwaded of the truth of what he holds, but is reſolved that all the world ſhall never perſwade him to the contrary. Not ſo much for love of that he maintaineth, (for what love can he have to the doctrine of Juſtification by inherent righteouſneſſe and good workes flowing thence, who is a ſtranger to good workes and an <hi>enemy to all righteouſneſſe?</hi>) but in hatred of the other ſide, that deſires to depreſſe man, and to exalt free grace.

But, as the taſte and feeling of ſuch undeſerved love and kindneſſe ſoone vaniſheth in this hypocrite, ſo doth his truſt in God, ſo ſoon as the ſenſe of Divine Goodneſſe is over, although the bleſſings themſeves remaine.</p>

                     <p>Faith looks upon Gods warrant as a command to apply general promiſes as made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to every believer, and to apply them to himſelf in particular. <hi>Remember thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto thy ſervant wherein thou haſt commanded me to put my truſt</hi>

                     <p>And this he believeth not only when he actually feeleth, but even when he feeleth not ſenſibly the love of God towards him, but rather the contrary. For even then he is reſolved, <hi>though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Job 13.15</note>, for his faith (no more than hope) is not grounded upon ſenſe, but upon promiſe. As the ſap is not alwayes in the branch, yet ever in the root: ſo the ſenſe of ſpiritual priviledges and comforts by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the promiſes, is not alwayes in the believer, yet the ground of his conſolation is never removed, becauſe that is ſo firmly laid up in the promiſe, that when in himſelf; his ſoule refuſeth to be comforted, yet the Word is a continual ſpring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him, that when he can find no comfort in his own feeling, he finds it in the Word, and is able to ſpeak in faith, that is <hi>my comfort in my trouble, thy Word hath quickned me</hi>

                     <p>He ſpeaks of the promiſes by hear-ſay, not as taſting them.

It is delightful to read or hear the great works and miracles which Chriſt did, and upon that account, he readeth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his life in all the Evangeliſts, but never cares nor ſeeks to be Evangelized, or to find any of the power and influence of the ſame Chriſt upon his ſoul, according to that power which he exerciſed upon the bodies or ſouls of men, in giving them firſt, faith to believe, and then cure upon their believing. He is no more deſirous to feel the power of Chriſt, and to have experience of him in himſelf, then the Phariſees, Sadduces, and the reſt of the Jewes to whom he preached, and before whom he wrought all his mighty works, were, <hi>to be doers of his Fathers will, that they might know of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be of God, or whether Chriſt ſpake of himſelf</hi>

                        <note n="y" place="margin">Jobe 42.5.</note>, which further confirmed his belief. There is great difference between hear-ſay, and ſight; between diſcourſe, and acquaintance; imagination, and ſealing to the truth of God<note n="z" place="margin">John. 3.33</note>.</p>
                     <p>An hypocrite may heare what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches, but only the Chriſtian knoweth the meaning of the Lord, and the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he <hi>only hath the mind of Chriſt</hi>

                     <p>This is that wherein the meaneſt Chriſtian goeth beyond the greateſt Clerks (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified); yea, beyond Satan himſelf.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as the parents of the blind man, that could tell that he <hi>was their ſonne,</hi> and that <hi>he was borne blind, but by what means he now ſeeth, they knew not</hi>

                     <p>He thinks it ſafeſt to caſt himſelf upon God for the greater, but not to truſt him too far for leſſe matters; for the heavenly inheritance, but not for earthly mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; as if herein, God had left every man to uſe his wits and induſtry to ſhift for himſelf. His faith ſeemes very ſtrong in beleeving his ſalvation by Chriſt, but not able to bear him up againſt temptations to ſin in providing for the things of the world. And no marvel both his faith by which he beleeveth is but a fancy, and ſalvation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in his eſteem no better; therefore, there he can make you believe any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he apprehends no danger of miſcarriage: for it is not to him a pin to chooſe, whether he get to heaven or not, however he hath taught himſelfe to ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

And 'tis not promiſes (in his opinion) that ever made any man rich: therefore he reſolves to look to himſelf, and to take the beſt courſe he can to be <hi>rich in the world.</hi>

                     <p>If he did indeed equally value heaven with earth: he would be as loth to truſt God for that, as for this. He is content to truſt him for heavenly things, becauſe he looks upon them as trifles in compariſon of earthly; but denyeth him credit in the things of the world, as being of more conſequence and value in the hypocrites eſteeme. He deales with God, as ſome wary men do with ſlippery chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they will truſt them for a ſmall parcel, or for ſome braided wares, or things out of date; but not with any commodities of uſe, and in preſent requeſt, which are every mans money.</p>

That God is as much engaged to give him daily bread, as pardon of ſinne, or glory it ſelf; that the promiſe for the one, ſo far as it is good for him to receive it, is as abſolute as the other. He doth indeed value heaven before earth; but relieth equally on the promiſe for both, becauſe the ſame God promiſeth both, and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually engaged for both. Therefore <hi>David</hi> prayes as confidently for <hi>building of his own houſe</hi>

                     <p>He is confident that he hath ſo ſurely taken hold of Chriſt, that Chriſt and all his benefits are undoubtedly his: He thinks he can, for a need, ſhew you Chriſt in his hand; as a Papiſt can his Crucifix, or mock-Chriſt; and can lay out all the benefits of Chriſt before you ſo exactly and methodically, that you ſhall not call for one of them, but he hath it ready to ſhew; at leaſt, in a map, or picture; in his head, in his brain. In a diſcourſe he is cunning and nimble at it, as ever <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Alexander the Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith</hi> were. And becauſe it is ſo perfectly at his tongues end, he ſtrongly conceiteth it to be in his heart too, where it never came.</p>
                     <p>He relieth more on his faith, than on the truth of Chriſt. Let Chriſt ſay what he will to the contrary, yet if this hypocrite have but a ſtrong conceit that he is a partaker of Chriſt, all that Chriſt can ſay, ſhall never beat this opinion out of his head, which he calls faith in his heart. He reſteth more on his own ſtrength, than on Chriſts power. And is ſure he hath Chriſt, becauſe he thinks ſo: and, as if he were able to take Chriſt priſoner at his pleaſure, he talks ſo confidently and freely, what he can put Chriſt upon and make him at any time do for him, as if he had made him as ſure, as the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> who uſed to tie their gods with chaines, that they might not forſake them.</p>
                     <p>But all this while, no ſigne or ſhew of <hi>Chriſts apprehending of him:</hi> he hath nothing of <hi>Chriſt formed in him,</hi> no ſubſtantial ſolid image of Chriſt, but only a paper-picture appeareth upon him.

                        <note n="l" place="margin">Mark 9.23</note>: becauſe Chriſt holds him faſt united in his own hand, that all the power of Satan cannot make him to let go his hold, nor obſtruct him in obtaining any thing from God; becauſe he not ſo much holdeth faſt Chriſt, as he is holden faſt by Chriſt. Therefore it is that even he who one while looking on his own palſy-feeble hand of faith, cries out complaining? <hi>Quis eripiet, &amp;c. who ſhall deliver me</hi>

                     <p>He never brings an hand to receive Chriſt, but he with the other <hi>gives himſelf unto God as one that is alive from the dead:</hi> yea, there is not a member of his body, but he conſecrateth it as holy to the Lord, by laying his hand upon it, and offering it up, as, not only an <hi>inſtrument</hi> to work for God, but as a <hi>weapon of righteouſneſs</hi> to fight for God, if need be<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6.13</note>. He never laid hand upon a mercy, but he accounted it as a debt on his part, to offer up the ſacrifice of praiſe; For, although he know Gods grace to be free in reſpect of money, that is, of merit to procure it, yet he will not let it be ſo free, as not to returne ſome duty and ſervice upon the receit of it. In this ſenſe he follows the Councel of Chriſt, to buy<note n="w" place="margin">Revel. 3.18</note>; but, with Gods money, not as deſerving the <hi>gold</hi> he purchaſeth, but as performing the homage which he oweth.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth that God would never admit of a lame, or imperfect ſacrifice. If it wanted any thing it muſt not be offered upon his Altar. He will therefore never offer up a maimed imperfect faith, that hath not an hand to work by love, as well as an hand to receive for neceſſity. He not only ſaith with <hi>Abraham, Lord what wilt thou give me</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 15.2</note>? but he reſolves with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>offer up his only Son,</hi> and that by the ſame faith wherewith he received him, whenſoever God calleth for him<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 11.17</note>.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrite is more affected with terrour then with comforts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have ſeen what he is in the matter of <hi>Aſſent,</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> or truſt: we muſt now trace him further, and conſider his <hi>feeling,</hi> as the effect and fruit of both the former; eſpecially of application. For it is not poſſible that Application ſhould be without affection. And the affection is according to the objects apprehended, and the manner and meaſure of mans apprehending of them. The objects of faith moſt proper for Application, are either <hi>threats</hi> or <hi>promiſes;</hi> anſwerable whereunto the heart is affected, either with <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>diſcomforts;</hi> or with <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi> In which method, the remaining Characters of this hypocrite are to be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
                     <p>He ſeemeth to be much affected with joy upon the Application of promiſes: but, as the application was but counterfeit, and pretended for his own better grace, ſo his joys and comforts are but forced and without continuance, as we ſhall ſhew anon; but his <hi>terrours,</hi> upon the apprehenſion of threatnings, affect him indeed. For theſe are not fained (as his comforts be) but real, and ſuch as he can neither avoid nor diſſemble. The reaſon is, becauſe the comforts being but from his own ſtraining of promiſes, applied without warrant, or leave from God; they affect but from the teeth outward; but his <hi>terrours</hi> ariſe from another foundation, <hi>the ſetting of his ſins in order before him</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Pſalm 50.21</note>, and ſetting home of threatnings, by God himſelf: ſo as now he cannot but be terrified in another manner then before he ſeemed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
                     <p>He was comforted in jeſt, but is terrified in earneſt. In the one he made ſhew of what he had not, in this he cannot diſſemble what really lies heavy upon his heart, this like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> leane kine devoureth the fat, ſo that there is no ſigne or relique of them remaining. The one was but a borrowed thing, but this is the <hi>portion of his cup</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſalme 11.6.</note>. No ſinner in <hi>Zion</hi> ſo much afraid, as the hypocrite; <hi>fearfulneſſe</hi> hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overtaken, but <hi>ſurprized him</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Eſay 33.14</note>. It is a thing he lookt not for: and therefore affecteth and amazeth him the more. A Piſtol ſhot off at ones powle, makes the ſtouteſt to tremble, when he would not ſo much as ſtartle at the going off of a whole Canon, when he ſeeth the fire given to it.</p>
                     <p>Every hypocrite having a guilty conſcience, muſt needs when God takes him to do, have an accuſing conſcience too, eſpecially when the light of the Word ſhineth upon it, letting him ſee in what termes he ſtandeth with God his Judge. Now, the Word is to his conſcience, as <hi>the Sun that ſhone upon the water</hi> early in the morning, cauſing the water to appeare to the <hi>Moabites as red as blood;</hi> and then to conclude <hi>this is blood</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">2 King. 3.22, 23.</note>; and therefore calling upon conſcience, to gaul him to purpoſe, as they to themſelves, <hi>now Moab to the ſpoile.</hi> Now, even <hi>Felix</hi> a Judge, <hi>trembleth</hi> before his priſoner, to hear of a <hi>judgement to come</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 24.26</note>. For now he ſeeth that there is a judgement for all, and a hell for the wicked, but chiefly for the hypocrite, and therefore now he knowes there is no eſcaping of <hi>devouring fires, and of everlaſting burnings.</hi> He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now terrified to purpoſe, whoſe comforts and joyes were but a pageant for ſhew.</p>

                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.16.</note>: this is the <hi>breaſts</hi> allowed them of God<note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 66.11.</note>. There is indeed an uſe of terrours belonging unto them, to humble them for ſin, and to prepare them for grace; but, terrours are not their proper allowance as they are children, but only as the rod or ferular to keep them in order. Sometimes fire is uſeful to the living, but clothes are more proper for all times and ſeaſons. Men uſe to cloath the living, not the dead, to whom, according to the ancient cuſtome of ſome countries, fire was rather applyed; yet ſometimes fire was made uſe of for the benefit of the living. Clothes warme by cheriſhing and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the natural heat that is within: they never warme a dead body. But fire will heat, yea roſt and burne up dead fleſh. The clothing of a Believer are the mercies of God in Chriſt <hi>covering him with the robes of righeeouſneſſe and clothing him with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſalvation</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 61.10.</note>. And, he having in him the inward heat of ſaving faith, theſe cloathes do warme and comfort him. But the fire of judgement is more proper for the Reprobate, firſt not warming, but rather burning him at preſent with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious and unnatural heat; yet, beginning with cold, as a feaver that begins in ſhaking, and quivering, and ends in ſcorching comforts are his cloathing, the fire of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the hypocrites portion.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite holds forth comforts, as commodities painted upon a cloth without his door, but apprehendeth terrours as a fire in his bones: the true Believer feedes upon comforts as his meat, and upon terrours as his phyſick: the one makes uſe of comforts, as a chap-man of his credit, when he knowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his grief, that he muſt ſhortly ſhut up, and hide his head; the other hath comfort within when he is at the loweſt without, becauſe his faith hath compounded with his creditor, who will again ſet him up.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrite feeleth, and beareth terrours unwillingly.</hi>

                     <p>Even when he beareth leaſt, he is ſoon weary, and deſireth to be eaſed: But if God give him his load, he is <hi>as a wild Bull in a net</hi>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 8.8.</note>, theſe croaking terrours that creep upon me wherever I go. He murmures and repineth at terrours, but labours not to be truly humbled under them, and therefore ſtrives to be rid of them, as <hi>Saul</hi> of his evil ſpirit. For no man is willingly tormented in that flame which tends to burn him up. Therefore <hi>Felix</hi> being terrified, putteth <hi>Paul</hi> to ſilence. He will hear no Preacher that ſhall follow him ſtill with the terrours of the <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> although they be no other but the terrours of the Lord. No man will endure a corroding ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaiſter, of which he hopes for no good. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> being affrighted, ſtayed not till God put him away; but, the place and communication being too hot for him, <hi>He went out from the preſence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 4.16.</note>, that is, in a place of exile, baniſhing himſelf in the moſt remote countrey that he could find.

                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the true Believer willingly beares the terrours of God,</hi>

                     <p>He knowes that it is good for a man to be ſometimes under terrours, that he may thereby take occaſion to lay himſelf low before God: Therefore albeit no afflicton be joyous as ſuch for the preſent, yet he bares this as a man doth a corroſive to eate out proud fleſh that hinders the cure of his wound. <hi>David</hi> was under great terrours for his great ſinnes, but when he was loweſt in the Dungeon we finde him praying for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his ſinne, purging of his heart, and creating of a clean heart in him, and then, and not till then, to be freed of the Rack that he was upon.</p>

                     <p>He is content to ſtoop under the hand and diſcipline of God, patiently learning by bearing the power of his wrath, that he might after taſte a more full draught of his ſweeteſt mercies. He hath ever hope in his greateſt tortures, as he that is ſick with phyſick given for his recovery, that his terrours ſhall end in comfort, his hell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Therefore in the greateſt terrours he runneth not from God, but cleaveth clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to him as a child to his father when moſt frighted with the rod; <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have heard thy voice, and was afraid.</hi> What then? Did he hide as <hi>Adam?</hi> or, go away from God, as <hi>Cain?</hi> No, but cleaves cloſe unto God by prayer, <hi>revive thy work,</hi> that is, of mercy; <hi>in wrath remember mercy</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Hab. 3.2.</note>. Yea, ſo farre is he from deſiring to be eaſed, till he be humbled and bettered, that he rather feares Gods hand will be taken off, and the plaiſter pluckt off, before his deadly wound be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite makes no other uſe of the terrours of God ſeiſing on him, than the impenitent thief on the croſſe, that fell to railing at Chriſt, becauſe for his ſake he ſuſtained ſuch a dolorous death to bear him company; the true Believer is like the other thief, by his torments brought to a more thorough ſight of his ſinnes, and to juſtifie God in his proceedings, with rebuking of his fellow, and cloſing with prayer to Chriſt to receive him to his Kingdome: the one blaſphemeth, the other prayeth.</p>

                     <p>He would not be thought to be without peace with God, nor much interrogated, when or how made. That he rather would have to be ſuppoſed, then ſifted. He hath framed to himſelf a peace with God; but without God. He is fallen into it, and is ſtrongly perſwaded of it: but he knowes not how he came by it, or upon what termes. It is not a peace of Gods proclaiming, but of his own deviſing; God pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily bids <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to proclaime this to all the world, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked</hi>

                     <p>His peace is without purgation; yea, without pacification: for the quarrel on both ſides is ſtill maintained. The hypocrite harbours the old Traytor ſin, againſt even <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> and God ſtill abhorreth the receiver and abettor of his enemies, as much as he doth the chief Rebel; God comprehendeth none in his peace, but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe exception of ſinne, and with condition not only to bear armes, but to fight ſtoutly with the whole Nation of this <hi>Amaleck,</hi> with whom <hi>he hath ſworne to have warre unto all generations</hi>

                     <p>His peace with God is his war with ſinne. Before he fought againſt God in behalf of ſin: now, he comes over to God, and beares armes againſt his former Lord.

A peace therefore he hath with God, but no ſecurity from war in the world. Upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſſault or conſpiracy of ſinne diſcovered, the alarme is ſounded, he ſtands to his armes, and goes out to battell upon every inſurrection of concupiſcence, aid from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is demanded, and granted: his life is a continual warfare, even when his peace is at the firmeſt with God.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite comes to God for peace, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to <hi>Joſhua;</hi> for a league<note n="n" place="margin">Joſh. 9.8.9.</note> wilily pretending that he comes from a far Countrey, meerely upon the fame of the greatneſſe <hi>of the Name of the Lord:</hi> but, the true Chriſtian comes unto him as <hi>Amaſai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> bringing with him <hi>the children of Benjamin and Judah,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thine are we David, and on thy ſide thou ſon of Jeſſe: peace, peace be unto thee and peace be to thy helpers</hi>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10</note>. <hi>For the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Job. 20.5.</note>; his joy is a triumph with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a victory, a trophee without a fight; a Judgment without debate, and hearing of both ſides: The Jewes rejoyced in the <hi>Baptists</hi> light, for a time<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 5.35.</note>: they were much taken with the newes that the Kingdome of God was ſo near at hand: but that joy vaniſhed; like beauty that laſteth not long even where it is in greateſt perfection (becauſe, but skin-deep;) that they never mourned with him<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 7.32.</note>: they took no notice of the neceſſity of repentance which he alſo preached: nor, of <hi>bringing forth the fruits</hi> thereof<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 3.8.</note>. Even <hi>Herod</hi> was <hi>glad</hi> to heare him, but not at all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the ſinne which <hi>John</hi> reproved. This is a very pleaſing deluſion to our hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, to comfort himſelf in the hope of good; without troubling himſelf to repent of the evil.</p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the Believers joy is the harveſt of ſorrow.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heavineſſe is the fore-runner of joy to him that is heavy with godly ſorrow; as carnal joy is the inlet to all helliſh terrour, where godly ſorrow takes it not at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and makes it fly back to make him mourne that is ſo full of falſe joy. Such joy is the ground of ſorrow, as godly ſorrow is, of ſpiritual joy. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourne for they ſhall be comforted</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5.4</note>. Chriſts way of giving joy is to give the <hi>oile of joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the Spirit of heavineſſe</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 61.3.</note>. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtrowed joy, but where he found the waters of mourning running, and even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing the ſoule, whereby he findes the Believer to have need of ſome dryer path and ſome more pleaſing ſteps to walk upon. This, the Believer knowing will go this way, or none, to joy.</p>
                     <p>In him therefore joy ſucceedeth ſorrow, as the thread the needle; he remembring that promiſe; <hi>bleſſed are ye that weep now, for ye ſhall laugh</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 6.21.</note>. It comforteth in ſorrow, for he ſaith, as the Pſalmiſt, upon good experience, <hi>in the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts refreſh my ſoule</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſ. 94.19.</note>. No ſickneſſe; no Phyſick; no wounds, no plaiſter. And as true joy ariſeth from, ſo it is cheriſhed and encreaſed by godly ſorrow: for, <hi>as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in him,</hi> ſo <hi>alſo his conſolations much more abound by Chriſt</hi>

If Chriſt once with-draw himſelf, this hypocrites joy is loſt, not in godly ſorrow for his abſence, but in diſcontent at his own loſſe of the loaves.</p>

                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.16.</note>, Chriſt is never abſent to faith, therefore faith, even when the eye ſeeth him not, <hi>believing in him, rejoyceth with joy unſpeakable and full of glory</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note>. And when Chriſt is moſt preſent, the joy of a true Believer is rather in him then in his gifts. <hi>Lord lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon us</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſ. 46.</note>. <hi>I will behold thy face in righteouſneſſe. I ſhall be ſatisfied with thine Image,</hi> and, <hi>with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>

                     <p>He joyeth more in himſelf, then in his hoſpitality; in his holineſſe, then in his bounty. In his inward preſence, then in his outward additaments. Yea, when Chriſt is abſent, the Believer fainteth not: becauſe Chriſt hath not forſaken him, although he with-draw his preſence, he hath taken care for his ſecurity whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth. In the world he may have tribulation, but Chriſt tells him this for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>I have overcome the world</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Joh. 16.33.</note>. He takes care for this, and did it in his own perſon before he left the world.

Yet, this departure leaveth not the Believer without ſome joy to think of his return. Indeed to rejoyce with Chriſt in the proſperity of the Goſpel is no ſure ſigne of grace; for many rejoyce with the Bridegroom at the marriage feaſt, yea, and not none that have <hi>not the wedding garment.</hi> But to mourn in abſence, and to finde no comfort but in remembrance of his former company, and in hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, this is of the Spirit and of the Bride. <hi>I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi>

Thus his heart is tickled with the taſte and conſideration of theſe things, as in reading of a pleaſant ſtory which concernes his fancy more then his intereſt: or in hearing the deſcription of a pleaſant country, whether he hath a moneths minde, but no ſetled reſolution one day to go.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true beleevers joy is deeply taken in, not only as preſent food,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The bargain is driven and concluded between God and him. Therefore as when a trades-man buyes of the Merchant, after they have bargained, he takes ſome part of the commodity which he is able to bear, home with him preſently, till he can get home the reſt of his bargaine: ſo doth the beleever, he carries home joy with him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no burden, yet of much Contentment to him, and this he takes as a beginning and earneſt of eternal life. And God ſpeaks unto his heart, when he takes up this joy, as you like this, ſo ſhall you finde the reſt, and better. So ſoon as he beleeveth to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as taking God for his own, <hi>he rejoyceth with joy unſpeakable.</hi> He conſidereth of heaven as a City prepared for him, and of God as his maine portion in it, and of joy as the chief food, he ſhall there feed upon: therefore he labours to take in as much therof at preſent as he can hold, becauſe he looks upon it as his own, with which he may be free, and of which he heareth Chriſt, the chief authour of it, ſpeaking to all ſuch as he is, <hi>Eat O friends; drink, yea drink abundantly O beloved</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Cant. 5.1</note>. He looketh upon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as his own, in which his name is written<note n="y" place="margin">Luke 10.20</note>, to be one of the poſſeſſours of it, as a portion caſt out by Gods own lot for him from all eternity, and that as his eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance for ever to be enjoyed.</p>
                     <p>According to this intereſt, is his joy; a ſincere, maſſie, ſubſtantial, feeding, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy; a full joy, even when without outward things wherein the hypocrite rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth moſt. It is that which gives him not only contentment, but ſtrength. It layeth hold on God even when he is departing, and lives upon him when the beleever cannot live in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite rather makes a ſhew of joy, then ever took it down: the true beleever takes it down, even when he makes no ſhew of it at all: the one floteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the water of joy, the other diveth down to the bottome of it: the one likes it, but bargaines not for it, the other ſelleth all he hath to buy it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> The Hoping Hypocrite, Is he that hopeth in God without God.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S is the mother, ſo is the daughter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Defin.</note> ſaith the Hebrew Proverb<note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 16.44</note>. Such as this hypocrites <hi>faith</hi> is, ſuch is his <hi>hope:</hi> the one is a <hi>reed ſhaken with every winde;</hi> the other a bladder filled with winde; which we muſt therefore prick and let out. As faith is the <hi>primum vivens,</hi> the firſt thing that lives, ſo hope is <hi>ultimum moriens,</hi> the laſt that dieth in a Chriſtian. If it were not for hope, oft-times the heart would break. While there is life, there is hope; and while there is hope, there is life in a Chriſtian. It therefore concernes every one very neerly, that would enjoy cleane life, as we ſay, to ſee carefully to his hope, that he be not cheated, as this hypocrite is, with an imaginary falſe hope that will periſh, when he hath moſt need to leane upon it, and to be borne up by it.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that he can no more entitle himſelf to hope, than unto faith; but he that hath the fore-head to lay claime to the one, will have the impudence to challenge a right in the other. Therefore we often read of the hypocrites <hi>hope;</hi> not that he indeed hath it, but ſtrongly imagineth he hath it. He beleeves ſo with the beſt faith he hath: therefore is that often attributed to him, which he ſo confidently claimeth, that yet neither is, nor can be at all truly found in him. So, we call him the <hi>hoping</hi> hypocrite, not that he truely <hi>hopeth,</hi> but only ſeemeth ſo, and would ſo be eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>A hope he hath, and that (if you beleeve him) is in God; but ſuch, as God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought nor owneth. For, true hope is a ſupernatural grace wrought by God in the heart of a true beleever, whereby he waiteth and expecteth the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the promiſes which by faith he hath beleeved. God who is <hi>the God of all grace</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 5.10</note>, is particularly ſtiled the <hi>God of hope</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 15.13</note>, as being the Authour as well as the object of all hope that is true. But how can this hypocrite entitle God to his hope, whom he never knew, but by the hearing of the eare, and whoſe hope is wholly deſtitute of all thoſe properties which are in that hope which God worketh in a beleever, as we ſhall after demonſtrate? True hope is alſo as properly the daughter of faith, as grace is the workmanſhip of God. Charity therefore is ſaid to <hi>hope all things,</hi> becauſe <hi>it beleeveth all things</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4</note>. How then can he hope any thing with a ſupernatural hope, that never was owner of ſaving <hi>faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not denyed that faith differs from hope in ſundry things: faith is before hope, and leads it up to the object, hope followeth as faith leadeth; they differ in their objects; faith hath for its object the whole Word of God; hope, only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (we beleeve the torments of the wicked, but we do not hope them;) the object of faith be things paſt, preſent and to come; but the object of hope is onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing future<note n="*" place="margin">Futura ſpae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant quicunque ſperant. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                        </note>; the objects of faith be all things revealed, the object of hope, only <hi>good things</hi> to come. They differ alſo in their acts, faith aſſenteth to, and applieth the promiſe; hope expects and waits the accompliſhment; faith gives intereſt, hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects livery and ſeiſin; faith is imployed about reconciliation and holineſſe of life; hope is chiefly taken up about the retired and raviſhing thoughts of glorification,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63232:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> the end and crown of faith; faith in ſome part, takes poſſeſſion of Chriſt here, hope waits for a more full and glorious poſſeſſion and fruition of Chriſt hereafter. But all theſe differences notwithſtanding, there is no parting of theſe two graces; he that will have one muſt have both: he that wants the one, cannot be truly poſſeſſed of the other. I therefore conclude that what ever this hypocrite boaſt of his hope, it is but vaine boaſting; he will one day finde it ſo, when God ſhall unmask him, and give him <hi>the juſt recompence of reward,</hi> fo all his counterfeiting, which he muſt expect; for, coyners and counterfeiters of the Princes money was never reputed or puniſhed leſſe then high treaſon. And what <hi>is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Job 27.8</note>? His <hi>hope,</hi> that is, his boaſting of it, might be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to ſome profit and <hi>gain</hi> among men; but the <hi>taking away of his ſoule</hi> ſhews what his <hi>hope</hi> was at the beſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian never hopeth in God, but he doth it from God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God firſt by his Spirit works hope in him, before he preſumeth to hope in God. He hath firſt the habit before the exerciſe: And when he hath that, yet he ſets it not on work without a ground to work upon. He firſt looks on the promiſe by the eye of faith, before his hope dares expect the thing promiſed. Whatſoever God promiſeth, hope waiteth for; ſo that the promiſe is the ground, as well as object of hope. Faith is the plummet, Hope the Anchor, and love the Cable of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſoul. The Anchor muſt have ground to faſten on, ere it can ſecure the ſhip: and the ground muſt be ſounded by the plummet of faith, ere the anchor be let down. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had firſt a promiſe, of which faith took the depth, and then he ſets the anchor of hope, to faſten on it for the accompliſhment thereof: and ſo, <hi>againſt hope he believed in hope</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 4.18</note>.</p>
                     <p>Yea, the promiſe is ſo the ground of his hope, that he makes it the only ground. Gods <hi>goodneſſe, power</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> looked at by ſome as grounds of hope, are not ſo to him, without the promiſe: for, what warrant can he have to hope in Gods goodneſſe, faithfulneſſe, or power, but by vertue of the promiſe; and, that promiſe applied by faith? But, when once he hath made ſure the promiſe, then theſe are excellent props and pillars to ſtrengthen his hope, even <hi>to rejoycing in hope</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 12.12</note>. He therefore faſtens his anchor upon the promiſe, and the things within it, and upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth indeed that <hi>faith is the ground of things hoped for</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 11.1</note>; and ſo he makes uſe of it, not as the object on which hope faſteneth, for that is only the promiſe; but, as the inlet to hope to faſten on the promiſe, faith having firſt laid this foundation, that God is <hi>faithful God, and his words are true</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Sam. 7.28</note>, and he hath made the promiſe, which faith believeth, applieth, and reſteth on; and ſo layes a good ground for hope to build <hi>expectation of accompliſhment</hi> thereupon. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>I waite for the Lord, my ſoul doth waite, in his Word do I hope</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pſalm 130.5.</note>. His <hi>waiting</hi> is his <hi>hoping;</hi> and, Gods Word, that is, his <hi>promiſe,</hi> is the ground of his <hi>hope</hi> even in God himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite, is as ſhe that undertaking to diſcerne a needle on the top of an houſe, would ſtill ſtand in it that ſhe ſaw the needle, even when by her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhe could not ſee the houſe; for he profeſſeth to hope in God, yet never came ſo near God as to believe in him, or to know what he is, and what he hath promiſed. The true Chriſtian is as <hi>Abrahams ſervant,</hi> that when meat was ſet before him, <hi>would not eat,</hi> until <hi>he had told his errand,</hi> and had ſome aſſurance of ſpeeding in the thing he went for; ſo the Chriſtian will not feed himſelfe with hope, till he ſee what God hath in ſtore for him, upon which he may faſten. The one hopes in God, in whom he believeth not, the other beleeveth, and therefore ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Hypocrite will hope, what he neither doth, nor dares beleeve.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Character </seg>1</label> We have ſeen in his deſcription, how prepoſterous he is, to hope before he have faith: here we ſhall finde him ſuperſtitiouſly modeſt, in <hi>not daring</hi> to believe what he profeſſeth to hope for. It is preſumption, ſaith he, to make too ſure of my part in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63232:161"/> heaven by a certainty of ſaith, faith muſt go no further than generals. Chriſt came to ſave ſinners; of which number I hope to be one, but I dare not abſolutely believe it. I ſhall never deſire more then a certainty of hope, leaving certainty of faith to preſumptuous ones that dare be ſo bold with God. Thus he divideth hope and faith, which like hypocrites twins are never aſunder.</p>
                     <p>Hereby he declareth plainly what his hope is, when he neither knoweth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor the power of God. For, if <hi>faith be the ground of things hoped for,</hi> what can he hope for that by faith he believes not? He can look upon <hi>rem verbi,</hi> the thing promiſed, by hope, before he beholds <hi>verbum rei,</hi> the Word of promiſe, by faith? Faith looketh on the evidence and aſſurance which is the promiſe, in regard whereof the thing promiſed <hi>is preſent to faith,</hi> which <hi>is the evidence of things not ſeen</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note>. Hope looks on the inheritance and performance, in reſpect whereof the promiſe is expected. And what more abſurd, than that hope ſhould have any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty at all without faith. any more then an anchor ſhould have any ſtay without ground to faſten upon. <hi>Hope is the anchor of the ſoul</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note>, and faith muſt go before to ſound the ground or hope cannot do its office. No marvail then if this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites hope be as the <hi>houſe of ſpiders</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Job 8.13.</note>; for ſuch is his vaine waiting for heaven without faith, who becauſe cannot believe (not finding in himſelf the conditions and effects of faith), will yet pretend to hope to do himſelf a pleaſure; but by no means to believe; becauſe that is too much: as he accounts every thing elſe, which he ſeeth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and cannot reach himſelf.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the Chriſtians hope is ſubordinate unto faith,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>what he dares not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he dares not hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He looks not upon hope as a natural prop to ſtay up mens hearts that have to do with men, whom he cannot well tell what they be, or what they intend. Sometimes their countenance, words and carriage promiſe faire, but without any poſitive and certaine engagement by word or writing: ſometimes, they are more ſevere and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: and ſometimes when they promiſe, it is but a mans promiſe; and nothing more <hi>ſure</hi> than this, that <hi>men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie, to be laid in the ballance they are altogether lighter than vanity</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Pſalme 62.9.</note>; therefore here many times, let him be as ſtrict an obſerver of man as he can, and by the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity judge of him as honourably as he can, yet he knows not well what to believe, to be ſure of it; therefore he dares not be over confident: many things fall out between the cup and the lip; and how many have broken promiſe that yet have been counted very honeſt and juſt of their words? He will therefore not be over confident: only becauſe he ſeeth all things have a promiſing aſpect, he will hope well. And further than this he dares not go. This is humane hope in man; and yet this is all the hypocrite hath in God.</p>
                     <p>But the true Chriſtian hath to do with a God that liveth for ever; and changeth not<note n="p" place="margin">Mal. 3.6.</note>, nor is there in his nature ſo much as the <hi>least variableneſſe or ſhadow of turning</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">James 1.17</note>. He knoweth whom he hath beleeved, and his hope is of a more ſublime and divine extract, and given him immediately <hi>by the God of conſolation</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.16.</note>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here keeps to the nature and rules of this hope, which is as inſeparable from faith as heat from fire. If he <hi>rejoyce under hope,</hi> it is becauſe <hi>he hath acceſſe by faith</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 5.2.</note>; and never dares to expect performance by hope, till he firſt give glory to God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <hi>promiſe.</hi> And then againſt all diſcouragements of humane <hi>hope, he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> in divine <hi>hope</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 4.18</note>; he believeth ſo as to be <hi>in hope</hi> and aſſurance of the performance<note n="*" place="margin">Credidit in ſpe gratiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſpem naturae, <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                        </note>. He knows that the God of hope muſt not only give him ſome joy and peace, but <hi>fill</hi> him <hi>with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> ere he can <hi>abound in hope</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 15.13</note>. And that hope ſo built and bottom'd will <hi>never make aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Rom. 5.5</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite pretending modeſty betrayes his ignorance and infidelity both at once; his <hi>ignorance</hi> of the true nature of hope to which he pretendeth; and his infidelity, in not believing God upon his Word; the true Chriſtian declares his true modeſty and faith too in not daring to own any hope towards God, but that which ſprings out of faith; the one playes with the word hope, without the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63232:162"/> thing; the other improves the thing to the utmoſt, becauſe he hath both word and thing in him.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrites hope is carnal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſavours more of the dunghil, not only for the pedigree and extract, but for the uſe and exerciſe of it. For, how ever this hypocrite will ſometimes ſeeme very eager after the things above, as <hi>David</hi> longed much after ſome of the <hi>waters of Bethlehem;</hi> yet, as <hi>David would not drink it, but poured it out upon the ground</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 23.16.</note>, when brought unto him, ſo this hypocrite is not inwardly ſo haſty or thirſty after the things of heaven, when God even thruſteth them into his boſome, and <hi>ſtretcheth out his hand all the day long,</hi> to perſwade and draw him to accept thereof; he will rather <hi>poure out</hi> this water of life <hi>upon the ground,</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 10.21</note> or <hi>cast it behinde him;</hi> and, when Chriſt again and again, yea, very often would have <hi>gathered him</hi> in for himſelf, as <hi>an hen her chickens under her wing, he would not</hi> come at him<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 23.37</note>: But he runs yapping or chirping after any meat thrown by any other hand before him, or rather lieth ſcraping in a dunghil, till the Kite make him his prey.</p>
                     <p>So that, if you mark him ſtrictly, you ſhall ſee him for one wiſh for true grace, to put out ten for a large eſtate, peace and freedome from trouble in the world, for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly children, and good portions for them; for honour, preferment; his hopes runne moſt naturally and ſtrongly this way. O that I could once get ſuch or ſuch a thing done! then were I made for ever (perhaps, undone for ever:) but as for <hi>heaven,</hi> and for giving you an account of his hopes that way, and of the reaſon of that hope which he vaunts to be very high in him: you ſhall ſeldome or never hear him that way inclined, unleſſe when he is caſually asked the queſtion: and then commonly he gives ſuch an anſwer as tends more to commend himſelfe, than to give glory to God, unleſſe from the teeth outward: rather to ſave his credt, than to comfort his ſoule from any ſolid ground of conſolation laid up in him.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He labours not ſo much ſtrengthen his hope touching the things of this life, as to get aſſurance of better, that is, of heavenly and everlaſting conſolations and of good hope through grace. He neglecteth not the meaneſt promiſe for the meaneſt b eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this life, no more then he reſteth in the greateſt.

                        <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note>. His hope is as the needle truly toucht with the load-ſtone, that never ſtands ſtill, till it directly point to the North-pole; it never reſteth and fixeth on any thing below heaven.

Thus with the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> he delights to tell God a ſtory of his own good works. But he thinks to ſalve all with this, that he placeth no confidence in works done by ſtrength of nature, or before regeneration and juſtification, but ſuch as the fruits of the grace of God in his heart. And did the <hi>Phariſee</hi> do leſſe? He begins his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with <hi>God, I thank thee I am not as other men</hi>

                     <p>He faine would have heaven, and hopes for it; but he makes no haſt towards it, or to make ſure of it. Counterfeit hope is in ſhew very modeſt, becauſe in truth but a counterfeit, and knows well that ſhe ſhall come ſhort of what ſhe hopes for, and therefore no haſt, to be made aſhamed. Shame will come faſt enough upon her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe make no haſte towards it. Few people after ſentence, make haſte to the whipping poſt, or galllows. This hypocrite knows his <hi>hope muſt periſh,</hi> therefore he will hold it up, and himſelfe in it; ſo long as he can. Hence he will tell you, he is not ſo haſty to be gone out of the world, as ſome pretend to be; he can ſtay for heaven, till his work be done on earth. And, if God will let him live to <hi>Methuſalems</hi> age, before he take him out of the world, he ſhall be very well contented: not becauſe he can hope for any great content here, but becauſe he hath leſſe hope of any when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted hence.</p>
                     <p>And, as for thoſe things which ſtrike terrour to the wicked, and are as daggers to his heart, death and judgement: he is ſo far from hoping for either of thoſe dayes, that he heartily wiſheth they may never come, and trembles to hear and think that they will come, as not only <hi>Faelix</hi> an Heathen, not yet admitted within the pales of the Church, did at the very mention of <hi>the judgment to come</hi>

Neither is true hope dulled or diſcouraged, but rather whetted and made more earneſt, by delayes. As <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great hath well obſerved. <hi>Cuncta deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deria dilatione creſcunt; ſi non, deſideria non fuerunt.</hi> All deſires are increaſed by delay: if not, they were never true deſires: wiſhes they may be, hope they are not.</p>
                     <p>Yea, <hi>hope</hi> is ſo <hi>earneſt,</hi> that it is earneſt by grace, for that which is to nature moſt terrible. What more terrible than death? yet the Chriſtian deſireth to <hi>depart and to be with Chriſt</hi>

                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19</note>. Can a man rejoyce, when he indeed conſidereth that he lieth under the greateſt miſery?

His hope is at full tide, yet cannot ſpare one tear for ſin, he hath no hand for the poor, nor for any good work. He hath no ſtomack to endure faſting, no knees for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no time for humiliation, for <hi>waſhing</hi> his <hi>hands,</hi> or for <hi>purifying his heart</hi>

Many ſuch roaring hopers there are in the world, that talk this out aloud; and if God will accept of him upon theſe termes, well and good; if not, he will runne the hazard. But, this hypocrite is of a more demure and auſtere deportment: he profeſſeth hope with his lips, and doth keep in from open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed debauchedneſſe; yet in his heart he ſo carries his confidence, that he concludes, he <hi>ſhall have peace</hi> howſoever: to all ſuch may juſtly be applyed that of the Prophet,<note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 2.37.</note>

                     <p>If he be not careleſſe altogether, but looks a little about him, he knows his hope to be of ſo baſe an original, and ſo meere a phantaſme that well may he doubt, not as one of little faith, but as having none at all. Therefore he is alwayes wavering, floating like a wave of the ſea. Now in ſome hope, by and by concluding <hi>there is no hope</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 2.25.</note>; And becauſe he knows that if it be once taken for granted, that hope gives aſſurance, then he is gone: therefore ſeeing he cannot hope to get aſſurance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will do his beſt (or rather his worſt) to drive all others from aſſurance too, that all may fare alike.</p>
                     <p>Hence, he calls aſſurance of ſalvation <hi>an unhappy ſecurity, preſumption and a faithleſſe perſwaſion</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Rhem. <hi>Annot.</hi> in 1 Cor. 7.27,</note>; and ſo it muſt needs be in him that is ſo void of faith.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the hope of a Chriſtian gives full aſſurance of the thing hoped for.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deny not but ſome who have true hope may be without aſſurance, as he that is truly living may be without health. But where hope hath her perfect work, it worketh aſſurance, as naturally as life produceth not only motion, but a good ſtate of health that the body may move with more vivacity and activity. As faith begets a plerophory of faith; ſo hope, <hi>a full aſſurance of hope to the end</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 6.11</note>. Hence hope is compared to an <hi>Anchor,</hi> and is called the <hi>Anchor of the ſoul,</hi> which hath theſe two properties, to be both <hi>ſure and ſtedfaſt</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">verſe 19</note>; now an Anchor muſt take not only true hold, but faſt hold, or it can never ſecure the ſhip. If it take faſt hold the ſhip is ſafe, unleſſe the ground be looſe and uncertaine: but here is no fear of that, becauſe this Anchor <hi>enters into that which is within the veile,</hi> which is no other then Chriſt himſelf now in heaven, and there <hi>appearing in the preſence of God for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, ſuch aſſurance doth <hi>hope</hi> give to a Chriſtian (unleſſe when extraordinarily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by ſome violent tentation) that it makes him (having a promiſe believed by faith) to hope, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> not only for things difficult, but even impoſſible in nature, and contrary to all humane reaſon: as he did for a ſonne long after <hi>Sarah</hi> was paſt child-bearing. And even the troubled conſcience, when moſt toſſed on the waves of tentation, dares not let go his hold to caſt off all hopes of heaven, when it ſees nothing but hell before him, but reſolves thus, <hi>though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Job 13.15 <hi>Seneca.</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>the adverſaries of Judah,</hi> that when they could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to build with Gods people, hired <hi>Counſellors</hi> to hinder the work<note n="i" place="margin">Ezra 3.4, 5</note>; ſo he ſets Jeſuites and others to plead againſt that aſſurance, which he cannot get: the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Zerubbabel, bringing forth the head-ſtone thereof with ſhouting, crying, grace unto it</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Zech. 4.7.</note>; the one diſgraceth the aſſurance

Or he builds upon his external formal profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and from thence concludes an aſſured hope of ſalvation, when he cannot be ignorant that his heart is like the inſide of the Phariſees pot, filthy throughout, how fair ſoever the outſide be, to whom Chriſt denounceth a <hi>woe,</hi> &amp; deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſalvation<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 23.25</note>.</p>

                        <hi>Charity</hi> is of the firſt magnitude; <hi>the greateſt of theſe is Charity</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.13</note>, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> have their uſe, but <hi>Love</hi> is tranſcendent. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are wrought by God, yet are not <hi>in</hi> him: but, God is <hi>Love. Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> bring us unto God, but <hi>Love</hi> ſhall be turned into union with him in heaven; they bring us to heaven, but this ſhall abide in heaven. Among the elements, fire is moſt eminent; among mettals, gold is moſt refulgent; among the ſtarres, the Sunne is moſt reſplendent; and among graces, love is ſupereminent. Therefore the hypocrite will be tampering with this grace above all other. As we have therefore traced him in his walkes and attempts upon <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> ſo we muſt now enquire into his arts and diſguiſes in the matter of his <hi>love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All graces have need to beware of being alloyed by the levaen of hypocriſie; but, moſt of all, <hi>love the bond of perfection</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 3.14.</note>; which, being more familiar, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative, is moſt apt to be counterfeited and abuſed: <hi>Philoſophers</hi> make <hi>Juſtice</hi> the ſumme of all vertues, but God makes love the comprehenſive grace that containes in it all duties, even to the <hi>fulfilling of his own whole Law</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13.10</note>. Therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſetteth <hi>love</hi> in the firſt place, like the <hi>chief of the firſt three,</hi> among <hi>Davids</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies<note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 23.</note>; being the mother of <hi>Juſtice</hi> her ſelf, and giving forme unto her. A juſt action not done out of love, is not juſtice. All duties proceed from love, and love is a duty that is owing to all. He loveth not, that performeth not every duty out of love. He payeth not his debts, that rendreth not love: this is a debt that grows due faſter then it can be paid, and muſt be alwayes paying, when all other debts are diſcharged. A man muſt not only give; but in giving love, ſaith the Philoſopher, he may leave giving, but not loving. Among ſpiritual graces (which are all Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of the blood-royal coming down from the Father of lights) love as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Lady of honour, holds up the traine of faith in the wedding ſolemnity, and is given with her, as <hi>Bilhah</hi> with <hi>Rachel</hi> to beare fruit for her unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This makes love to be ſo often counterfeited, where true love is wanting. Many that are farre from love, yet being aſhamed to profeſſe hatred, <hi>cover their hatred by deceit,</hi> till their <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> can be hid no longer, but <hi>ſhowed before the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 26.26</note>. Simulation and love are incompatible. He that loves, cannot feigne, and he that feignes, cannot love. He therefore that counterfeits love, is worſe then he that coyneth counterfeit money. The Devil began his legerdemaine, he firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and practiſed this Art upon our firſt parents, pretending more love to man than God himſelf; he having even then <hi>ſeven abominations in his heart</hi> to blow up all mankinde at a blaſt.</p>
                     <p>Ever ſince, he hath kept a School of deceivers, wherin he hath trained up many cunning Scholars, but none like the religious hypocrite: nor in any age hath he brought forth ſo many Crafts-maſters in this trade, as in this: never more ſhew, never ſo little love. <hi>He that hateth, diſſembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 26.24</note>.

                        <hi>They ſpeak vanity every man to his neighbour, with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they ſpeak</hi>

                     <p>But this hypocrite exceeds the ordinary ſort and ſize of diſſemblers with men; for he carries his diſſembling up as high as God himſelf, and ſeekes to put as great a cheat upon heaven, as upon earth; being grown ſo cunning, as thoſe cut-purſes and pick-pockets that will uſe their Art, not only in the face of the Court, or at the very time and place of execution of ſome of their fellows: but, will pick the pocket of the Judge himſelf. God may ſay to him, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> to <hi>Sampſon</hi>

                     <p>He loveth God, not only for what he doth; but, for what he is. He hath reaſon to love him for his love. But findes cauſe to love him more for himſelf. The object of love is ſome excellency in the thing love faſteneth upon. If it love more for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in that object which feedeth the lovers humor, and ſuits beſt with his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is luſt, not love: for he loveth him in hope to enjoy what himſelf hath a minde unto, rather than for what the party in himſelf truly is, without reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf. And this love is mercinary, if not fornicatory. <hi>Ille mercenarius, &amp;c.</hi> He is a <hi>mercenary</hi> that hath his eye upon the wages more then upon the work. And he is no better then a <hi>fornicator,</hi> who loves God meerly to enjoy his own pleaſure. But the true Chriſtian loves God better then al the world, yea, better then heaven it ſelf; <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſalm 73.25</note>? he loves him for himſelf. He cares not for heaven, were it not for God. Nay, heaven is no heaven to him without God.</p>
                     <p>Not that it is unlawful to love God for, what he doth for thoſe that love him; but, that it is more noble and genuine, to love him for what he is in himſelf. We cannot be without the former, therefore good reaſon we ſhould love him for the ſupply he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth. <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice, and my ſupplication</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſalm 116.1.</note>, ſaith he that was no feigned lover, but yet, becauſe that is a truth in Divinity as well as in Philoſophy, <hi>Quod efficit tale, eſt magis tale,</hi> that which makes good in the effect, is much more good in the cauſe. Therefore, every man that rightly underſtands the worth of the effect, muſt needs know the cauſe and fountaine whence that effect iſſued, to be worth much more: and that, if any thing in the effect requireth love, the goodneſſe of the cauſe commandeth it much more: So that the Chriſtian is then moſt rational, when he moſt paſſionately loves God for himſelf. The infinite wiſdome, goodneſſe, power, holineſſe, love, mercy that is in God, as in the Ocean, muſt needs attract more love from a wiſe and conſiderate lover, than thoſe ſtreames that iſſue thence. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Chriſtian takes pattern from God. God loves for his own ſake; therefore a true lover loves God chiefly for God, as he is in himſelf. For he that <hi>loveth God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God loved him firſt</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 John 4.19</note>, and duely conſidereth that God did thus not for his ſake that now loves God: but, for his own, who was firſt in the love: he cannot but make that the chief ground and object of his love in God, which God himſelf made to be his own in loving man.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the hypocrites love to God is like that of <hi>Amnon</hi> to <hi>Tamar</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 13.2 and 15.</note>, he was firſt ſick for her; and then having ſatisfied his luſt, was upon all other accounts more ſick of her; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Ruth</hi> that loved <hi>Naomi,</hi> even when ſhe had <hi>no more ſonnes in her womb,</hi> of which, <hi>Ruth</hi> might hope to chooſe another <hi>husband</hi>

                     <p>This hypocrite can borrow from Gods day, and from his ſervice, for his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; but in no caſe from himſelf, to beſtow upon the Lord. His own ſix dayes will not ſerve the turne: but, as <hi>David</hi> muſt have <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijahs</hi> one ſheep, ſo muſt he have Gods one day who hath reſerved no more unto himſelf. If a feaſt (though not unlawful in due time and manner) or a paſtime come in the way, ſo that one muſt yeild, either no Prayer, Sermon, or no paſtime, God muſt be the loſer. He is not early and forward in holy exerciſes, but driveth off, till the time grow too ſhort. So God hath either no ſervice, or to no purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Delay is a degree of denial. To let an honourable friend ſtand knocking and dauncing attendance till we be at leiſure, and all our own buſineſſe done, were great incivility. But men anſwer God ſo, as he forbiddeth them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one another. <hi>Go, and come againe, and to morrow I will give thee</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 3.28</note>. It was
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63232:168"/> the Churches fault that ſhe <hi>opened not</hi> readily unto Chriſt<note n="g" place="margin">Cant. 5.2, 3</note>, and ſhe paid deer for it<note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 5, 6, 7</note>. In the mean time this is the beſt of the hopocrites ſervice; in whom ſelf-love driveth into ſtreights the love, not only of man, but of God. Where in the firſt place, love and honour are due, it is a wrong to put Chriſt our husband and Prince to take the ſecond. To honour him with a ſecondary honour is treaſon; as, to love him with a ſecondary love is adultery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrarily, <hi>The true Chriſtian giveth God every way the prime of his love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True lovers are the only Larks, the only Nitingales; they are early and late, day and night expreſſing love. <hi>David prevented the night watches</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 119.148</note>. He thought on God by night, yea at <hi>midnight</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Verſe 62</note>; <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, and with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee in the morning</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Eſay 26.9</note>. The morning prayers and meditations do ſweeten and ſanctifie the day. Evening prayer is a ſweet cloſe of the day-light, and haply of our life. Therefore a Chriſtian goeth to his bed, as he would to his grave, and riſeth in the morning with a taſte of the reſurrection. He ſeeketh firſt the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe. If any love be too proud to come behind that love, he giveth it a bill of divorce. <hi>Tuas res tibi habe,</hi> take thine own, and be packing. Out of doores with the bond-woman and her ſonne; elſe were he not fit to follow Chriſt as a Diſciple, or a true lover, but muſt heare that ſharp reproof uttered with indignation, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 16.23</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as a woman that promiſeth marriage, but ſhe muſt firſt marry, and bury another husband; but the Chriſtian contracteth with the Lord <hi>in verbis de preſenti,</hi> to be preſently his, only his, and that for ever; the one will follow Chriſt when he hath firſt done his own buſineſſe which he mindes more, and loves better; the other, as <hi>Peter</hi> and his fellows, <hi>forſake all to follow Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 19.27</note>, without indenting, or preferring ought before him, whom he loves more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrites love is ſoon cooled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fond lovers are ſoone on, and ſoon off: their love is ſoon kindled, ſoon quenched; like children, won with an apple, loſt with a nut. So this hypocrite loves God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knows him, and flies in his face, or flies off, ſo ſoon as he feels him in the leaſt, contrary to expectation. Although he want nothing, yet he is angry for any good another receiveth, for any love expreſſed to another. He is a murmurer as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, upon every occaſion is hard to be pleaſed, but never ſeeks to pleaſe; he muſt have all the love, although he ſhew none; which argues not only a weak faith, but a wavering love. He is up in armes, and at defiance with God every day for one trifle or another, for bread, for water, for quailes, which ſhewes him to be but an humorous peeviſh lover, whoſe love is too dearly bought, and more hardly kept. He is ſuch a lover, as will ſoon turn enemy, and blaſphem the Lord to his face, if he want his will, or fail of his carnal deſires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtians love will take no check.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Many waters cannot quench</hi> his <hi>love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for</hi> this <hi>love, it would utterly be contemned</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Cant. 8.7.</note>. Lovers, the longer acquainted, the more loth to part, and the more deſirous to meet again. Their dayes of abſence, and of want of full fruition, is a life of longing and ſighing. Sometimes they are joyful, ſometimes ſorrowful: now, a breath; then a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and thereby a re-inforcement of love. Then, the love-tokens walk; ſo it is with the Chriſtian. His love to God may be diſturbed by tentation; but, it is not extinguiſhed by infidelity, or put out of the courſe of obedience by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of paſſion or deſpaire. For, ſeeing <hi>all things work together for good to them that love God</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note>, therefore a reſolved Chriſtian (as <hi>Job</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Job 1.21.</note>) is thankful even for afflictions.</p>
                     <p>He conſidereth that the change which appeareth in Gods dealings towards him, is occaſioned not on Gods part, but on his own, whoſe heart is ſtarted aſide from God, and become out of frame. All is kindly taken by the truly loving ſoule, becauſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63232:168"/> aſſured of the fidelity of God, and of the reality of his love. He acknowledgeth the ſame love, though he finde not the ſame effect. For when the caſe differeth on mans part, the courſe on Gods part, muſt needs vary, yet without variation of his love. In health, food; yea, a feaſt: in ſickneſſe a bitter potion, and purgation proceeds from the ſame love. Wherefore the true Chriſtian can caſt himſelf upon the love of God, though God ſhould think fit to kill him out-right<note n="r" place="margin">Job. 13.15.</note>. As thoſe that ſailed with <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt needs keep the ſhip, as the only means of ſafety; ſo a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſafety, in the midſt of the greateſt ſtorme, is to continue in the love of Chriſt, which giveth him footing, as it were, on dry land, in the midſt of the ſea of this world.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is in and out with God, as God pleaſeth to diſpenſe outward bleſſings or croſſes to him, as thinking himſelfe to deſerve better; the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heart is fixed, and cleaves to him what ever befals him, acknowledging the worſt that befals him to be leſſe then his deſert; and the leaſt that is beſtowed, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his merit: the one falleth out with God, for his skinne, if but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the other had rather God ſhould ſcourge him with whips of Scorpions, while he loves him, then let him alone in his ſins to periſh by them, rather then diſpleaſe him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This Hypocrite, even when he ſaith he loves God, doth not like <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>He is ever and anon apt to finde fault with Gods dealing, as not ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited for his love. Againſt providence he excepteth, that it is too partial; that others have too much, and he too little. He excepteth againſt the Law, as being too ſtrict. What? ſaith he, may I take no liberty on the Lords day? no pleaſure or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by taking revenge? <hi>no thought for the fleſh,</hi> to gratifie and ſatisfie ſome <hi>luſt thereof</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 13.14.</note>? Who can love truly, and yet abhor to be like him whom he loveth? who can love his Prince, and miſlike his juſtice? who can love his image, that hateth his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Nay, where there is diſlike, upon unlikeneſſe, there can be no love. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection cannot ſubſiſt, and be conſtant without judgement; nor love, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the Chriſtians love honoureth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>and juſtifieth God in all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He loveth adviſedly, becauſe he liketh; and liketh the more, becauſe he loveth upon choiſe. Love is the palate of the ſoul to taſte how ſweet the Lord is. Becauſe he likes God, he cannot but love him; and loving him, he affecteth to be like him, even to be <hi>transformed into the ſame image</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note>. What he cannot attain unto, he miſliketh not, but admireth. However the world chargeth the Lord, he ſeeth <hi>no unrighteouſneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 92.15.</note>, no imperfection <hi>in him.</hi> He hath none but honourable thoughts of God. If he cannot preſently aſſoile all objections or doubts, yet he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth God righteous, and himſelf a beaſt. He ſubſcribeth to providence, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with whatſoever portion God ſetteth out for him in outward things. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is not, <hi>God loveth me not, becauſe he giveth me no more:</hi> but this, <hi>he giveth me no more, becauſe he loveth me wiſely, and for my good.</hi> He approveth whatſoever God ſpeaketh; yea, if God threaten him with ſharp judgements, <hi>good is the Word of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Iſa. 39.8.</note>. He liketh well whatever the Law commandeth, or forbiddeth. <hi>The Law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is holy, and the Commandment is holy, and juſt, and good</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note>: <hi>but I am carnal, ſold under ſinne</hi>

It is in mine heart, ſaith he; but, examine it not by my actions. The greateſt injury that can be done him, is to call in queſtion his love to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is never able, (if you put him to it) to prove it by any thing done for God. He is content to afford the Lord a parcel of good words, <hi>my God we know thee</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Hoſ. 8.2.</note>; <hi>my Father, thou art the guide of my youth</hi>

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 6.10.</note>, becauſe love refuſeth no paines.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note>; nay, love is glad of any command, <hi>what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> ſaith he unto God, even before the command is gone forth<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 9.6.</note>. Love is a diligent affection, and the fountain of diligence. We may well derive <hi>diligentiam á diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> diligence from dilection or loving; the things are conjugate no leſſe then the names. A part of that diligence is in word and profeſſion. Love is no mute, but rather a Blab. It muſt tell the Lord how well it loveth him. I love thee, O Lord my ſtrength, ſaith <hi>David</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 18.1.</note>. And againe, I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice<note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. 116.1.</note>. But it ſtayeth not there; it proceedeth to action. He is mindful of that of his bleſſed Saviour; <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 14.15.</note>: and that, to <hi>Peter, loveſt thou me? feed my ſheep</hi>

                     <p>Nay, his love reſteth not in action, but cheerefully carryeth him on to ſuffering. No paines, no hardſhip night or day, heat or cold will be thought too much for him, whom his ſoule loveth: no taske ſeemeth hard. <hi>I account not my life dear unto me</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 20.24.</note>; ſaith the Apoſtle. No condition is refuſed, that may bring him to the preſence and fruition of Chriſt his dear and loving Spouſe, though it be by death, yea by martyrdome.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.9.</note>; and that for his ſake: and becauſe this is not onely the great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 22.38.</note>, but the ſpecial command of Chriſt; <hi>this is my Commandment that ye love one another, as I have loved you</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 14.12.</note>. His love therefore is farre from true and ſpiritual love: eſpecially where under colour of love he drawes another, man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, into ſinne. It is rather a knot, then love, hatred, then good will: a rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Peace and Crown of Chriſt, a brother-hood in evil, as between <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> a combination in miſchiefe againſt God, as that of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> againſt Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Gods own are overtaken, to love whom they ſhould not; at leaſt, not ſo farre as they engage; as, <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> a good man, and of a ſweet diſpoſition, loved both Father and ſon, <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jehoram,</hi> too well, and too farre. So that he was charged with <hi>helping of the ungodly, and loving them that hate the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">2 Chron. 19.2</note>. Yet this was not in hypocriſie, although without warrant from God. But the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite never loves, but he playes the hypocrite with man, as well as he tranſgreſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Sometimes alſo love is begun for vertue, and then by being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the perſon, men love the perſonage more then the vertue; the Caſe in ſtead of the Jewel: and this, however the godly fall into it, yet they do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in the reality of love, but onely miſtake in the Object. This they do without God, and out of God, in regard of warrant; but not in regard of the ſubſtance of their love.</p>
                     <p>But the hypocrite not only loves without God, but contrary unto God, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting love, even when he placeth it not on a wrong Object, as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending love to <hi>David;</hi> or, calling that love, which is but luſt, or a Pander to it, as that of <hi>Jonadab, Davids</hi> brother, to <hi>Amnon</hi> his Nephew; putting him into a way to ſatisfie his luſt on his half-ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> which <hi>Amnon</hi> thought <hi>hard for him</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, till he was taught that wile<note n="h" place="margin">2 Sam. 13.2, &amp;c.</note>.

                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>a true Chriſtian lover loveth all, in God, and for God.</hi>

                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Sam. 21.7.</note>, as the ground of it was the feare of God, not to joyne in, or to be privy to the conſpiracy of <hi>Saul</hi> againſt innocent blood on the one hand; or, to the corruption of nature in <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to ſupport his own greatneſſe, or to revenge <hi>Sauls</hi> unworthy dealing with him, when he came to the Kingdome. True love ſaith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> is <hi>motus animi ad fruendum Deo propter Ipſum; ſe, &amp; proximum, propter Deum.</hi> A motion of the ſoul to the enjoying of God for himſelf; and himſelf and his neighbour, for Gods ſake; by loving God, all cleaveth to one; by loving one another, all become one.</p>

                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.10.</note>. So a Chriſtian loveth all men, but <hi>eſpecially thoſe of the houſhold of Faith</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>.

                        <note n="n" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.1.</note>. And this he doth as being a better Argument of true goodneſſe, then his believing.

                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that where there are more relations of kindred, neighbourhood, <hi>coheirſhip of grace,</hi> and the like; there love admitteth of multiplication and encreaſe: but this draweth not the lover from God, or from his way of loving, who is Author of thoſe relations, and the rule of love. The Chriſtian here hath a larger field for his love to walk in, but ſtill his love is both grounded and bounded in, upon, for, and by the God of love.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite loveth as the <hi>unjuſt Judge</hi> did juſtice to the Widow; <hi>not out of fear of God, or regard to man</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 18.4.5.</note>; the true Chriſtian in loving man, hath his eyes upon God, <hi>as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her Miſtreſſe</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſ. 32 2.2.</note>: the one loveth, not truly, conſidering why, nor how: the other, is as careful of the ground and end of loving as he is to love.</p>

                     <p>The Object of his love is not himſelf, but his brother: and that is not for what he will do for him, but what he is in himſelf. The load-ſtone of love is vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Object. This draweth out his affection; not, to ſerve himſelf, <hi>but his brother through love</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 5.13.</note>. He principally loveth for Gods ſake, in whom he loves him: and next for his ſake whom he loveth, as intending his good more then his own, in loving of him.</p>
                     <p>He obſerveth that precept, <hi>to love his neighbour as himſelf.</hi> He knoweth what is good for himſelf; and thence concludeth, if health, credit, juſtice, mercy, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, holineſſe be good for me, then are they good for him alſo, and he will do what he can to procure them. For, he makes conſcience of his Maſters Rule, <hi>whatſoever yee would that men ſhould do to you, doe ye even ſo to them</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note>.</p>
                     <p>It is not denyed, but a man in loving another, may have ſome reſpect to himſelf; if he be learned, wiſe, judicious, to learn of him; if humble, loving, gracious to imitate him: if any way profitable, to be a gainer by him, in a way of God, not of luſt, or of the world. But this is not the maine, nor the firſt thing for which the Chriſtian loveth another, but as the reſult, not as the moving cauſe, but as the reward of love; as man and wife, by ſhewing more love to one another for loves ſake, do reap more love from each other. No man can love God with the pureſt and moſt abſtracted
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63232:170"/> love that is moſt refined from all ſelf-love and mercenary baſeneſſe, but he hath ſome aime at the chiefeſt happineſſe, in loving of the greateſt good: not making a mans own happineſſe the firſt ground, but the laſt motive to love him beſt, whom we love moſt for himſelf. So, in proportion, a Chriſtian loveth his Chriſtian friend; not moſt, or, in the firſt place, for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite loves his brother as <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> taught the Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites to love <hi>Jacob</hi> and his family (<hi>ſhall not their Cattle, and their ſubſtance, and every beaſt of theirs be ours?</hi>

He firſt pleaſeth his fancy, and then his affection muſt act, let the Object be what it will. If he be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he cares not whom he loves.

                     <p>Where there is liberty of Election, at leaſt in loving, a Chriſtian laboureth to make his child, ally, friend, ſuch as may be lovely and acceptable. True love ever findeth worth, or maketh it. Or rather, the natural love prepareth the beloved for that love which he beareth to vertue. To love a man firſt, and then to endeavour to make him honourable, is a proceeding from nature to vertue. Nature of her ſelf honoureth a man, becauſe ſhe loveth him: but vertue either loveth, or deſires to love, becauſe ſhe honoureth him for the worth ſhe findes in him: love growing from honour being a better Argument of worth; then honour from love.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſetteth on the roof, and then thinkes of laying the foundation; or rather, cares not much whether there be any foundation at all: the true Chriſtian
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63232:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> maketh ſure of the foundation firſt, and then buildeth thereupon: The one putteth on love as a falſe Spectacle, and thereby every thing ſeemes fairer and greater than it is in his beloved: the other, endeavours to ſee without Spectacles, the true ſhape and worth of the party that he would love, before he let out his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                        <hi>This Hypocrites love is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erball; rather in wiſhing, then ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath words at will; Oyle and Butter enough in his mouth to ſupply all: but, he keepes all to himſelf: he will ſpare none of it to his neighbour, whatever his need be; or at leaſt ſo little, as will do him little good; too little to ſupply his neceſſities. He gives as good words as need to be: <hi>Depart in peace, be warmed, and filled:</hi> but
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63232:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> gives him not <hi>thoſe things that are needful</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Jam. 2.16.</note>. He may freeze for cold, and ſtarve for hunger for all this parcel of good words. Thus he deales with his brother, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that will ſay to a younger brother of a good family, <hi>I would you had been the heire,</hi> or, as ſome others, <hi>I would you had ſuch a living, ſuch a ſeat, &amp;c.</hi> for which he gets, <hi>I thank you, Sir,</hi> for nothing.</p>
                     <p>He that bewailes another mans miſery, and putteth not to his helping hand, is, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> like a Spectator in a Tragedy, that mournes much to ſee ſome ſad ſtory acted, but lets the Play go on: Whereas if true pity were ſeated in his heart, it would expreſſe it ſelf as well by the hand, as by the eye, or tongue.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtians love is helpful.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe, it is not real. According to his power his heart joynes with his tongue and his hand with his heart. His wiſhes are not idle or handleſſe: he is as ready to do good, as to wiſh well. If he cannot do all he would, yet he will do what he can: and where he can do no more, he will turn wiſhes into prayers; and from prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for thoſe that are godly: <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Phil. 4.19.</note>. If I cannot help you my ſelf, yet I will move my friend, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is able to do this and more both for me and you. One way or other, his love will help: at leaſt will ſhew <hi>a willing mind</hi> to do, as well as to talk. And this makes <hi>a man accepted,</hi> even of God himſelf; <hi>according to what he hath, and not according to that he hath not</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12.</note>. God rejects him not for <hi>what he hath not,</hi> but accepts him <hi>for that he hath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like a man of clouts, that may skare birds, but not relieve men: the true Chriſtian is like one of <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, that though he cannot reach the firſt three, yet he will do his part, as <hi>Benaiah</hi> and others<note n="w" place="margin">2 Sam. 23.23.</note> to be of the <hi>thirty:</hi> the one, hath tongue at will, but no hand; the others hand is longer, at leaſt buſier, then his tongue.</p>

                        </gap>,) alwayes about to give, but never giveth. He hath perfectly learned the merchandiſe of words and traffique of promiſe: but breakes, when it comes to performance. He gives nothing at preſent, when not only your neceſſity, but relation may expect preſent ſupply; but to ſalve the matter, he tells you ſeriouſly, <hi>I will put you in my will:</hi> perhaps, as he did whoſe legacy to his friend, was an halter to hang him. <hi>He boaſteth of a falſe gift,</hi> and therefore is no better then <hi>clouds and wind without rain</hi>

                     <p>It is he that hath holpen the world to that proverbial ſpeech; <hi>Ampullae verborum,</hi> which if it import not a <hi>bubble in the water,</hi> yet ſurely comprehends no more but a <hi>pot with an empty belly,</hi> an Apothecaries box, faire written on the outſide giving you notice of ſome rare drug or liquor contained in it, but hath nothing within anſwerable to the gaudy title. It is like <hi>Abſoloms</hi> low-belling of the people that had no more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome than to hearken to him. <hi>O that I were a Judge in the land, that every man that hath any ſuit or cauſe, might come unto me, and I would do him juſtice</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">2 Sam. 15.4</note>: but he meant nothing leſſe; <hi>So, fair words make fooles fond.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the Contrary, <hi>the Chriſtians performance overtakes his promiſe,</hi>

                     <p>His <hi>word</hi> is his <hi>bond,</hi> yea his <hi>oath:</hi> therefore he will performe, although to <hi>his own hinderance, or hurt</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 15.4.</note>. An oath with him is ſacred, ſo is his <hi>promiſe,</hi> although not ſo bound. For, he makes not a promiſe without God, as his witneſſe, as well as his warrant. And he will not forfeit himſelf to ſuch a witneſſe who muſt be alſo his Judge. God tyes him where man cannot binde him. Therefore he is careful, if it may be, to prevent his word, by doing the deed ſooner then he promiſed, (as lightnings appeares before the thunder be heard:) partly leſt the benefit ſhould loſe of 'its grace by coming loyteringly after the promiſe, and be ſued out as a debt, rather then accepted as a gift, and partly leſt himſelf, being a man, ſhould after be tempted to alter his own word, or prove (if not falſe, or unkind, yet) unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:63232:172"/>
                     <p>With him, it is an undoubted and indelible maxime, <hi>better give and not promiſe, than promiſe and not give.</hi> Yet in caſes of extremity, where expectation it ſelf may be ſome ſtay and comfort, he refuſeth not the bond of promiſe. But then, he entreth into another bond to his own heart, not to faile in that promiſe, whatever detriment happen to himſelf by performance. He is willing to help every way: by actual giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he hath it in his hand, and preſent neceſſity preſſeth; or, by a faithful promiſe to give ſo ſoon as he hath it, and the other needeth it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Saul,</hi> who thought he might take liberty to break Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and engagements with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>

                        <note n="b" place="margin">Joſh. 9.18.</note>.

                     <p>If, by Gods hand, a man be caſt into great ſtraits, not by any wilful negligence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſs or building Caſtles in the aire; but, it may be to try, and humble him, and to drive him cloſer up to God; and he, in ſuch a caſe, make his moan to this hypocrite, who is able to help him: the hypocrite will give him good counſel, becauſe counſel is cheap. <hi>Agree Sir, with your Creditors, pay every man his own, buy what ye lack.</hi> Thus he will afford him counſel, but not a penny to help him. He is (as too many elſe are) ready to look angerly and frowningly upon a man upon whom God hath frowned, and tells him, <hi>this you ſhould do,</hi> when he ſees that he cannot do it: <hi>this you ſhould have done,</hi> when now it is too late to do it, but helpes him not in the leaſt. For he could have and perhaps hath, told himſelf as much as this, without going to this hypocrite. He came to him for advice that is practicable, that might do him good, whereas all his counſel, is onely to upbraid and vex him in his greateſt grief and neceſſity. To whom the poore man might reply as he in the Epigram, <hi>quod peto, da cui; non peto conſilium:</hi> give me what I come for, or keep your counſel to your ſelf.</p>

If he ſee him engaged in law-ſuits, he claps him on the back, and upon good ſecurity lends him mony to wage law, that he may at once gain by the others loſſe, and be revenged by the hand and at the coſt of his friend, upon one that is more his enemy than his friend: or, he helpes him, to engage with him in ſome faction, or for other ends of his own; ſaying, as his friend ſaith, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adding to it. Doſt thou tell him thou art angry, with ſuch an one? he bids thee hang him, and ſhewes thee perhaps a way to do it. Doſt thou covet ſuch a mans houſe, or field? he bids thee never give over till either by foule means or fair, he be forced to ſell it to thee. Art thou afraid of ſome miſchief? he bids thee fly, and leave what thou haſt with him. Doſt thou ſuſpect ſuch an one that pretendeth friendſhip, to be falſe to thee? he bids the beleeve it, and truſt him no longer.

                     <p>He will give counſel that is practicable, and profitable to his friend. Counſel that is ſweet, like ointment or perfume that cheereth his heart.

                     <p>He is ſo wiſe as to remember that his friend conſiſteth of <hi>an old man,</hi> and a <hi>new man;</hi> and ſo joyneth himſelf to him to counſel, encourage, and aid that part which is reaſonable, or rather regenerate, helping him to ſee and amend his errours, loving not ſo much the eaſe, as the credit; nor the credit, as the conſcience of his friend. If gentler reproofs will do it, he tries their ſtrength firſt, gently telling him, you were too blame, too much tranſported with paſſion, intemperance with the world, &amp;c. Reduce your ſelf to your grounds, ſet limits and bounds to your appetite, your paſſions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If this will not do, he then woundeth that he may cure; becauſe he knoweth that <hi>faithful are the wounds of a friend</hi>

                        <note n="w" place="margin">Ver. 5</note>. He woundeth, but, as a Chirurgion, not as an enemy. It is no other wound then his friend, if he be ſo wiſe as he ſhould be, will rather deſire than decline. His lay is, <hi>let the righteous ſmite me</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Pſalm 141.5</note>. Therefore the Chriſtian never fears ſuch <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of his friends <hi>head,</hi> but goes on with his love and his work.

If you come to his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, perhaps furniſhed with dainty diſhes, although he be a very churle: yet at his table, he makes great proteſtations of hearty welcome, and bids you <hi>eat and drink, but his heart is not with you</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Prov. 23.7</note>. Rather as <hi>Nabal</hi> he is ready to die to think of his coſt. If he meet you in the way, where you ſtick faſt in the mire, or are able to go no further, either he wiſheth you ſome of his help at home, or, tells you of ſome body at hand coming after him that will help you, but never puts finger of his own to the work. He is your ſervant, and at your command, he kiſſeth your hand, or the hem of your garment, but with the kiſſe of a <hi>Joab,</hi> or a <hi>Judas.</hi> If words and complements will do, he will ſoone ſhew himſelf better bred than <hi>Nabal,</hi> yet not

                     <p>If he meet any man in the ſtreet or market, you would take him to be a <hi>Damon</hi> met with <hi>Pythias,</hi> ready to creep into the others boſome, or to lie at his feet; but, no ſooner is his back turned, but he is ready to look over the ſhoulder in deriſion, and to traduce him to the next he meets, and perhaps to boaſt how exquiſitely he complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſſembled with him. And ſo he is not content onely to carry two faces under one hood; but he will pull off the mask and ſhew them to any that will be troubled to take a view of them.</p>

                        <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> contended together in <hi>weeping</hi>

It is not denied but ſome ceremonies, that is outward expreſſions in the very geſtures and countenances of friends will thruſt in with true love: not ſo much for the loves ſake, as for reſpect the witneſſe and acknowledgement of deſert which is the ground, nurſe, and guardian of love; therefore love makes no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween affected complements, and down-right rudeneſſe, but ſhunneth both alike, that it may neither waſte complements, nor neglect that reſpect which civility, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and Religion require as a part of the debt of love. But to be a Maſter of the art of Ceremonies, and to aſſert ſuch a neceſſity of them as to exceed in their uſe, as it ſavours not of a ſimple, ſincere, ingenuous ſpirit, ſo it ſets the teeth of true love on edge. The Chriſtians maine care is to <hi>love, not in word, or in tongue, but in deed, and in truth</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Huſhai</hi> to <hi>Abſalom</hi> (whom he meant to ſupplant) when he cryed, <hi>God ſave the King, God ſave the King</hi>

                     <p>We have hitherto traced him in his verbal charity, wherein he gives only <hi>words</hi> inſtead of <hi>Works.</hi> But he, knowing he muſt needs give more than a ſound of words; elſe, he ſhould be judged of all to be but <hi>as ſounding braſſe, or a tinkling cymbal</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1</note>; He will therefore do ſomewhat more; he will adde <hi>deeds</hi> to his <hi>words;</hi> but ſuch as argue him no leſſe hypocrite then before. And his deeds are of two ſorts; the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the poore, ſo farre below him as to need his almes; the other, of an higher rank, to whom he profeſſeth <hi>friendſhip;</hi> but, in both, an hypocrite, the Ape of Gods children, no childe of God.</p>
                     <p>In his <hi>almes,</hi> he many wayes diſcovers himſelfe: but, in nothing more groſſely, then in the manner of doing them. If he doth it not <hi>with ſound of trumpet,</hi> he doth it as ill, with beat of drumme. He will do it <hi>in the Sinagogues,</hi> where the Aſſemblies are fulleſt; or, at leaſt <hi>in the ſtreets</hi> where moſt meet, <hi>that he may have glory of men</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 6.2.</note>. He will draw ſpectatours, or not draw his purſe. He will give only at his doors, for that requires the leaſt care, and makes the moſt noiſe, though that which is given be given at a venture, as the <hi>Roman Sportala,</hi> to all comers and clients. He can do nothing without ſtore of witneſſes; for, otherwiſe he doubts his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ſcarce witneſſe it for him another day; and, God may forget it, unleſſe to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his hypocriſie in it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He will eſpecially in giving private almes to particular men, take care ſo neere as he can, that <hi>his left hand ſhall not know what his right hand doth</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 6.3</note>; his left hand of oſtentation ſhall not be privy to what he doth with the right hand of commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as knowing that his ſecrecy in duty will be ſo farre from being an obſtruction
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63232:174"/> to his reward, that the more ſecret his almes, the more publick ſhall be Gods remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. <hi>His Father which ſeeth in ſecret, will reward him openly.</hi> He that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his eyes from the hypocrite giving private almes in publick, fixeth them upon the Chriſtians ſecret almes, that he may publickly declare the great difference he puts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                     <p>Secrecy in private almes, is a great ſigne of ſincerity; as the calling in of witneſſes is an argument that a man dares not truſt God without them. Therefore, <hi>pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion viſiteth the fatherleſſe and widow in their affliction</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Jam. 1.27</note>; to ſee how it is with them at home before they come abroad to complaine; or, having been abroad, remain unrelieved. This, 'tis better at a dead lift when none eye pitieth, no hand relieveth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the guift is double welcome, and the giver leſſe tempted to vanity and pride. The true Chriſtian <hi>conſidereth the poore</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſalme 41.1</note>; that is, wiſely caſteth about where is moſt need and deſert, and there he laies out moſt, where leaſt can be expected from man by way of reward, becauſe he looks for none, but from God himſelf; not doing it to merit, but to perform a duty; to be a gainer, not to his purſe, but to his peace.</p>
                     <p>He is not againſt publick almes in a publick way; he diſliketh not, but forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by his hand and tongue, neceſſary collections in the Aſſemblies. How elſe ſhould the Churches <hi>light ſhine before men</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 5.16.</note>? ſuch almes were enjoyned in all the Churches<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.1</note>. Almes muſt not ſo ſhunne the light, as to be aſhamed to be ſeen, but ſometimes ſhew themſelves that men may ſee charity is not barren, but fruitful with a witneſſe. Not doing them, to make other mens obſerving them the chiefe motive or end of giving them. Where-ever the poore brethren are in want, they are to be relieved when occaſion and opportunity call for it. If it be moved in publick, although but for a private perſon, even in publick, charity may and muſt be publickly expreſſed as a part of the obedience of faith<note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.7</note>. Not to do an almes, unleſſe it may be ſeen to account it loſt, if it be not ſeen; or, not to do any almes at all but what is publickly ſeen, he leaves to the hypocrite. The true Chriſtian hath in ſome almes many witneſſes, for the glory of God, and for the incitements of others to more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality; yet, in ſome, only the receiver, without any other, in ſome, only God, not the receiver, knoweth the benefactor.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite manageth his <hi>almes,</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi> did his <hi>zeal: Jehu</hi> cared not for God, but for the Kingdome; he pull'd down <hi>Ahab</hi> and his family, not to exalt God but to make way for himſelf to the Throne: zeal was the pretenſion, the Crown was the meaning; the good of the poore is pretended in the almes, but his own glory who is the Almner is intended: The true Chriſtian is as <hi>Joſephs Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> that ſo ſecretly conveyed his brethrens money into their ſacks, that they could not tell how it came there. <hi>We cannot tell,</hi> ſay they, <hi>who put our money into our ſacks</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 43.22</note>. The one will give nothing but in publick; the other giveth in publick when called upon, yet ſo as not to hold his hand in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrites charity is unjuſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One vertue is enough for him at one time. If he be juſt, he thinks he may well be excuſed from giving almes. If he muſt give almes, he muſt be excuſed from juſtice, not as confeſſing injuſtice, but as pleading a warrant of his rigour for the enabling of him to give almes. He pulls from him upon pretence of debt, when he ſhould rather feed and cloath him. If asked why? He ſaith, I take but mine own, and ſo I hope I do no man wrong. Let me firſt be paid what is owing, and then I can think of charity afterwards. Extremity of juſtice is the extremity of injury, and that is no other, to exact the utmoſt where nothing is to be had, but with the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and ſtarving of thoſe, that if we feed not, muſt ſtarve, although we take nothing from them. <hi>Charity ſeeketh not her own</hi> in ſuch caſes<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.5</note>. It is therefore uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable juſtice, which is injuſtice to ruine a man upon an account of juſtice, that we may after exerciſe our charity towards him.</p>
                     <p>He that took his fellow by the throat, ſaying, <hi>pay me that thou oweſt</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 18.28</note>, never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a word as, <hi>pay that thou oweſt not;</hi> yet for that which he both did and ſaid,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63232:174"/> His Lord condemned him as <hi>a wicked ſervant</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Ver. 32</note>, for not ſhewing the ſame pity to his fellow-ſervant in forgiving him, as his Lord had ſhewed to him. Rules of juſtice may be ſtrained ſo high as to <hi>turn judgement into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſſe into hemlock</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Amos 6.12</note>, this is no good foundation to build charity upon, firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a man with a ſhew of juſtice, and then to relieve him with a ſhew of charity; the juſtice is uncharitable, and the charity is no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                     <p>It may be he relieveth ſome, which deſerve puniſhment before relief, and this is a wrong to others; as, to give to rogues and vagrants, without puniſhing them firſt as malefactors, this is lawleſſe charity, being a contempt of the Laws, and an injury to others who better deſerving his charity are hereby beguiled of it. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a malefactor in his place, that is the priſon, where he is <hi>ſub lege,</hi> under the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Law; or when he is in ſome extremity and danger of life, humanity teacheth firſt to relieve, and then to enquire; but elſe, firſt enquire, and puniſh; then, relieve, is the rule of true charity as well as juſtice; to do otherwiſe is hatred under the mask of love<note n="s" place="margin">Lev. 19.17</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, this hypocrite ſeemes a very charitable man to ſome to whom he owes leſſe, while he is uncharitable and unjuſt to them to whom he owes more. He cares not what he giveth to, or waſteth upon ſtrangers, while his own friends, kindred, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the wife of his boſome are neglected, and ſuch as have deſerved farre better of him, are not requited; pity it is, that charity ſhould come under the laſh, yet this man with his falſe charity, cauſeth true charity to hear ill, becauſe his pretended charity is ſo far from doing well.</p>
                     <p>Or, perhaps he hath another humour, which is not to make an heire, but to ſettle a perpetuity in ſome corporation that will finde ſome way to lick their own fingers, or to pervert it; yet this pleaſeth him (although he might eaſily have foreſeene the abuſe) and this he will do, that his charity may bear his name like an <hi>Abſaloms Pillar,</hi> and all other offices of kindneſſes and retribution, and doing good to others who more need it, and may better challenge it, are ſwallowed up and buried under that one <hi>Pillar.</hi> Thus that he may make a noiſe in the world, and ſeem to go beyond other Chriſtians, he falls ſhort of very <hi>Infidels</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8</note>. <hi>Dat, ne reddat;</hi> to do what he is not bound to, he omitteth that to which he is bound; and, to be at liberty in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he caſteth off the duty of paying, like ſome who give largely to a Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but deceive their Paſtour. This is not charity, but humour and vain-glory; yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtians charity ſucceedeth juſtice.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Charity is juſt as well as kinde; orderly as well as compaſſionate. It is no time with him to do works of charity, till debts and duty be diſcharged. As our Law ordereth firſt, debts to be paid, then legacies; ſo charity it ſelf ordereth him, ſo to be charitable, as none ſhall have juſt cauſe to complaine of his wilful omiſſion of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary duty; or, of Gods order in the performance. Not that a man ſhould give no almes at all, while he owes any money to others: for then, many men ſhould ſeldome finde times wherein to give; but that no man ſhould be ſo large, or profuſe, as to diſable himſelf to pay his juſt debts, and to provide for thoſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; or to give away any conſiderable ſummes whereby any creditour ſhould be unpaid at the time of payment, unleſſe with his conſent. For he that ſo doth, doth not give his own, but another mans, which is not charity, but rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</p>
                     <p>He will therefore take pattern, not of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> who <hi>ſet his houſe in order,</hi> (of whom we read nothing of paying any debts;) but, of <hi>Zacheus</hi> who firſt divided his goods, that he might make reſtitution with over-plus, and then <hi>gave to the poor</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 19.8</note>. It is the undoubted Character of a truly charitable Chriſtian to begin with juſtice in paying debts, that is, all duties to which he is bound, before he proceed to voluntary enlargements of his charity, where he is free; and, to do duties freely, and fully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth love and care of humane ſociety, to which all particular and more private acts of an arbitrary charity muſt give place.</p>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:63232:175"/>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite deals by juſtice and charity, as <hi>Paul</hi> in a different caſe, by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Acts 23.6</note>, ſetting them together by the eares, that he might ſooner be quit of both; the true Chriſtian, is as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that not only gave order for the Paſſeover to be kept, but <hi>appointed the courſes of the Prieſts and Levites, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man according to his courſe and ſervice</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">2 Chron. 31.2</note>. His charity directeth his bounty, as well as it puts him on to be bountiful. The one begins where he ſhould end, not unlike the ſelf-juſtifying <hi>Phariſee</hi> in being very buſie about tything of <hi>mint, rue and cummin,</hi> but neglecting the weightier matters of the Law which were firſt to be done; the other as the ſpider in weaving of her web, begins at her bowels, ſo he begins at the center of duty, and after extendeth himſelf to the circumference of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>

A mad charity, that ſtriveth to exceed the pomp of Princes in their Palaces (if his purſe can reach it) in erecting Hoſpitals to lodge beggars; and, Monaſteries, to be ſties for God-bellie beaſts: nay, which is worſe, to endow them with revenues like Dukes and Princes, who pretend the devoting themſelves to voluntary poverty; yea, which is worſe, a charity (piety they call it) to images of ſtocks and ſtones, to maintain their Lady in the faſhion, and a new gown againſt every good time, after the example of the old <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who out-vied one another in giving their ear-rings of gold, to make <hi>a calf</hi>

                     <p>He firſt makes many beggars by oppreſſion and fraud, and then builds an Almeſ-houſe with ill-gotten goods to feed a few poor people, perhaps not a twentieth man of thoſe he hath impoveriſhed, like him that firſt <hi>robbeth,</hi> and then offers part in <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> which the <hi>Lord hateth</hi>

                     <p>And if herein he have unworthily failed, he hath defrauded himſelf.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:63232:177"/> will not work, idle droanes, drunken ſwearing unclean beaſts, that live in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood, ſcarce ever out of the Ale-houſe, while their poore wives and children ſtarve, or beg, through his wickedneſſe, are welcome to his door, he never does ſo much as the Laws of man, much more what the Law of God requireth<note n="c" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.10</note>, for their reformation; he feeds them, and perhaps cloaths them too, that he may have the name of a good houſe-keeper, and of a very charitable and merciful man to the poor, while in the mean time he is moſt unmerciful and cruel to their ſouls<note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 19.17</note>. He affordeth hoſpitality, but denieth inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Yea, this is too often found even in too many Miniſters, who getting into the richeſt and higheſt preferments of the Church, under the name of maintaining hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, maintaine more diſorders, and riot then any others of their eſtates round about them. Hence, like people, like Prieſt; nay, worſe Prieſt then people. He is firſt in the riot. <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Eſay 56.12</note>. Thus, both are better fed then taught; both have fat bodies, but lean ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this hypocrite better to his family, or to the children of his Ioynes. He provideth well for their backs and their bellies, feeds them to the full till they kick with the heele, at him that feedeth them; he cloatheth them with garments above his rank, or above his purſe, which makes them proud, even to the deſpiſing of their betters, and of him too: But of the ſoul he hath no care at all, to cloath it with vertue, with humility, and good diſpoſition. He may be at charge for their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to ſet them out, and make them more capable of preferment in the world; but, uſeth no meanes to <hi>traine them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 6.4</note>, for the good of their ſoules in reference to eternity. His care is only of the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative faculty, that the ſoul may do the office of ſalt to the body, to keep it from putrefaction.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He will feed ſoul and body too; if not at the ſame time, yet with the ſame care and charity. He will take his time for the one as well as for the other. And as the <hi>body is more worth then rayment</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 6.25</note>; ſo he knows one ſoul to be of more value then ten thouſand bodies without ſouls, or with loſt ſouls; yea, then the <hi>whole world,</hi> &amp; that there is <hi>nothing to be given in exchange for the ſoul</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 8.36, 37</note>. Therefore he carefully obſerveth the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the ſoul and the body, and the preheminence of the one above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He neglects not the body, becauſe it is the houſe, the caſe the organ of the ſoul; but his chief care is for the ſoul, whether it be of his wife, children, ſervants, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, friends. His charity is entire; He loveth not as a luſtful lover, that loveth chiefly for a face, or what elſe he hath a minde to abuſe; but he loveth as the father his child whom he loves in the Lord. He loveth thoſe that are good, becauſe they love God, and thoſe that are evil, that he may bring them in love with God.</p>
                     <p>Thus this hypocrites love is like that of <hi>Dives,</hi> the <hi>rich man which was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared deliciouſly every day;</hi> and kept a good Table for all commers;<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 16.19</note> eſpecially <hi>for his five brethren,</hi> but for their ſouls he never took care till himſelf was in hell<note n="k" place="margin">Verſe 28.</note>; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Solomon entertaining the Queen of Sheba,</hi> giving a ſpecimen of his wiſdome, as well as of his magnificence<note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 10.4, 5</note>, that all, ſervants as well as others, might <hi>be bleſſed in his preſence,</hi> as well as in his meat<note n="m" place="margin">Verſe 8, 9</note>; the charity of the one is gut-love; of the other, ſoul-love; the alms of the one is caſt away; the charity of the other ſaveth all.</p>

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63232:177"/> will extol and applaud him, and ſo pay him in report what they cannot returne in kinde. Thus he exerciſeth a kinde of commutative charity. In every almes, he aims at a reward from man, and he hath it<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 6 4</note>, or he will give no more. And God in judgement letteth him reap here what he hath moſt minde to, (becauſe ſome be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his charity;) that he may expect nothing hereafter. He doth nothing but to be <hi>ſeen of men,</hi> therefore nothing more ſhall be given him. He will be paid in this world, for all his good works, which makes him a miſerable gainer by the loſſe of his ſoul, and of his works together in the world to come.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>The true Chriſtians Charity is a dole.</hi>

                     <p>A free guift, to the poore mans belly; not a commodity ſold in the market.

                        <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 20.35</note>. Wherefore, if any thing come home, he will ſend it out again, by a new largeſſe, that he may die a creditor to God.</p>
                     <p>Nay, he loves not ſo much as to hear of his good works. The conſcience of a good work is enough to him: let the benefit accrue to the Receiver, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God. To have whereof to give, and to finde to whom to give, and eſpecially to obtaine grace to be willing to give, is an abundant reward to ſuch a giver. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is more glad of a meet object on whom to beſtow, then the poore man is to receive. For, if the Philoſopher could ſay, that <hi>unto a fortunate man, friends are neceſſary; not, to receive of them, but to have on whom to beſtow;</hi> much more muſt it needs adde to the happineſſe of a Chriſtian, to be ſo furniſhed, as having a better God to reward him in a better world. All that behold him thus giving, muſt needs ſay <hi>O happy Giver!</hi> rather then, <hi>O happy Receiver!</hi> Poſſibly he may tender a gift to a great man to prevent a miſchief, as <hi>Abigail</hi> preſented <hi>David,</hi> to ſave her ſelf and family from ruine, occaſioned by the <hi>churliſhneſſe and wicked folly</hi> of her husband<note n="u" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.27</note>; and, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſonnes did unto <hi>Joſeph</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 43.26</note>. But, he doth not with an aime to be a gainer by the gift, but only to be a ſaver when ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give. He uſeth not this as a trade, but as an extraordinary aſſay at a dead lift.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like <hi>Dives</hi> that made great proviſion for his rich kindred and friends at his own table, but gave not ſo much <hi>as of the crums</hi> that fell from his table, to <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying at his gate, ſo that his very dogs ſhewed more compaſſion then himſelfe<note n="x" place="margin">Luke 16.21</note>; the true Chriſtian is like the Jews at their <hi>feast of Purim,</hi> wherein he is as careful of <hi>ſending gifts to the poor,</hi> as <hi>portions</hi> to others: the one is like a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who gives a preſent to buy a better thing with it, and expecteth to ſee it againe with intereſt; the other is like <hi>Polycrates</hi> of <hi>Samos,</hi> caſting his ring of very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue into the ſea, without expecting ever to ſee it more; being alſo herein like him too, that as a fiſh unexpectedly brought that ring to the owner, ſo providence, without looking for, brings bleſſings to the Almner.</p>

                        <note n="y" place="margin">Micah 7.5</note>; for, this is a <hi>brother that will utterly ſupplant</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Jer. 9.4.</note>, he <hi>diggeth a pit for his friend</hi>

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63232:178"/> as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> proved men of worth, not for love of vertue, but to make himſelf honourable by putting them upon the proof; ſo this hypocrite is a great pretender of friendſhip to many whom he flattereth, that thereby he may try which among them all is likely to be moſt beneficial to himſelf; and to him will he be a friend, <hi>ut bene ſit ſibi,</hi> that he may be ſure to make a good market for himſelf. This argues him to be no friend, for that, as <hi>Phocion</hi> told <hi>Antipater, a friend, and a flatterer, are inconſistent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To do all things for his own ſake, is the general property of an evil man, and the more evil he is, the more this agreeth to him. Yet herein this hypocrite doth not truly love ſo much as himſelf, even when he loves none elſe but for himſelf: for he differs from himſelf. One thing he willeth, another thing he deſireth, and doth as the riotous perſon, that faine would be rich, but ſpends all. He makes a friend to ſerve his turn now, when he meets with a foole: but, ſo ſoon as his own minde, or intereſt alters, this friend will go with him no further, until he can work further upon his friend to make him turn knave. And this is the juſt recompence of him that will firſt be a fool to ſerve an hypocrites turne; He muſt after be a knave, or be turned out of favour. Yea, this alſo is the juſt puniſhment of the hypocrite, that, by diſſembling friendſhip, draws in others to ſerve him in a corrupt way, he muſt inforce them to turn knave, ſo often, that at length he dares neither to truſt them longer, nor to be rid of them at all, for fear they ſhould do him more miſchief then ever they did him good. This is the true reaſon why knaves finde ſo much favour in the world.</p>
                     <p>He ſeeketh not ſo much the friendſhip, as company of others, becauſe he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and aſhamed of his own company. He ſeeth nothing in himſelf, neither wiſdome in his head, nor vertue in his heart, to make him lovely to himſelf or others; therefore he ſeeks company that he may forget himſelf. There is, as the Phyloſopher obſerveth, a kinde of ſedition or ſeceſſion in ſuch a mans minde; no marvel then, if he make bad uſe of his friend, when he cannot maintaine true termes of friendſhip with himſelf. For of the two, he had rather be a friend to himſelf, then to his friend, and his care is to be loved rather then to love; and becauſe he is ever unſtable and fickle, and forced ſo to be (for evil men commit ſo many errours every day, while in a wrong way, that they muſt daily ſhift reſolutions, yea, vows and oaths too;) that he is ſtill apt to think himſelf not ſufficiently paid in that kind, and cries out, <hi>utinam aeque mihi pars eſſet amoris tecum.</hi> I would my ſhare in thy love were equal to thine in mine; when, if it be not, the fault is only in himſelf. He loves his friend to make uſe of him as a ſervant; therefore loves him not as a friend; <hi>Cum ſervo non colitur amicitia,</hi> True friendſhip cannot ſtoop to ſhake hands with a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not only becauſe too low, but becauſe diſproportionable, which makes the other as jealous as he. If this hypocrite be alone, and hath no friend, <hi>vae ſoli.</hi> Woe unto him<note n="c" place="margin">Eccleſ. 4 10</note>. He is as a man that hath but one leg, and cannot go. If he get a friend, it is but only to ſerve himſelf, to which friend he is at beſt but a wooden leg, which he can ſet on, and take off at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the Chriſtians friendſhip is the good of his friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is the true <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> that knows what belongs to <hi>brotherly-love.</hi> He looks upon friendſhip as it is in it ſelf, not as wreſted to ſerve turnes. Friendſhip hath alwayes been counted ſacred; and Law-givers have therefore been more careful of love and concord than of juſtice, that friendſhip may be preſerved inviolable, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever become of private commodity. Where love is, there is little need of juſtice, ſave what love it ſelf executeth. But we cannot ſay, where there is juſtice, there is no need of love. Every man needs friendſhip for the civil and ſociable life, as he doth fire and water for natural life; meane men need friends to ſupport them; and great men, to tell them the truth. Even the happieſt and wiſeſt men need friends, if but to exerciſe vertue, and to encreaſe it by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                     <p>A friend therefore is a moſt precious jewel, as honey for ſweetneſſe, <hi>as oyntment and perfume to rejoyce the heart</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 27.9</note>. He is as a brother, yea, as a mans own
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63232:178"/> heart, in the intending and procuring of good to his friend more then to himſelf. Such a friend is this Chriſtian, he begins with benevolence, the ground of friendſhip; he wiſheth and intendeth all the good he can unto him, and chooſeth rather to be a loſer by his love, then a gainer by loving. And as he is hearty in willing; ſo is he as ſerious and ſincere in procuring what he willeth: Alwayes provided that the thing willed be good in it ſelf; and good for him, honeſt as well as pleaſing. Friendſhip is only between thoſe that are good; and, in goodneſſe alone. Friends, if brethren in evil, become enemies.</p>
                     <p>He regardeth the good of his friend in the firſt place, that it may be well with his friend, although with ſome loſſe to himſelf. Not that his own loſſe is intended; but that his friends good is chiefly in his eye. Friendſhip aimes at the good of both; elſe, were it no friendſhip; but each friend <hi>eſteeming the other better then himſelf,</hi> neither of them <hi>looketh</hi> chiefly <hi>to his own things, but to the things of the other alſo</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Phil. 2.3, 4</note>. The love of a friend is natural and fatherly, deſcending, and providing for the good of him whom he loveth.</p>
                     <p>But in things honeſt, and communicable the Chriſtian ſeeketh his own good alſo: His heart truſteth in his friend, he takes delight and comfort in ſuch an one whom he may truſt, expects counſel, comfort, prayers and helpfulneſſe otherwiſe alſo, as opportunity is offered. <hi>We took ſweet counſel together,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> even of a falſe friend, till he diſcovered his falſhood<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 55.14</note>. There is a lawful ſelf-love, even in loving others; to be the better for them in ſpirituals eſpecially. The Chriſtian therefore in that nature loveth himſelf, and his neighbour as himſelf. Gods image in himſelf is neereſt to himſelf, that he loveth in himſelf. But he reſteth not there, he ſeeketh companions in vertue, not as being weary of himſelf, but that he may have a larger field to exerciſe goodneſſe, and both to impart and receive more good. Home is beſt, yet he goeth abroad to communicate his goodneſſe, as they that go to market to make many partakers of their commodities. He therefore <hi>having friends, ſheweth himſelf friendly,</hi> and <hi>ſticketh faſter then a brother</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 18.24</note>. He is more afraid not to love, then not to be loved; yet he would never love with the love of friendſhip, did he not expect love again. The mutual love of both is intended and expected, but he intends not ſo much his own profit, as the benefit of his friend whom he loveth as himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Laban,</hi> profeſſing great friendſhip to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and deſiring his continuance, not for the benefit of <hi>Jacob</hi> (whoſe <hi>wages he had changed ten times</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 31.41</note>, as thinking it too much) but becauſe the old fox had <hi>learned by experience that the Lord had bleſſed him for Jacobs ſake</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 30.27</note>, the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> preferring the preſervation of his friend before his own ſafety<note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 20.33, 34</note>; the one makes uſe of his friend, as <hi>Amnon</hi> of <hi>Jonadab,</hi> to aſſiſt him in his luſt<note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 13.4, 5</note>; the other as <hi>Mordecai</hi> of <hi>Heſter,</hi> for the ſaving of her ſelf, and of the reſt of the Jews Nation<note n="m" place="margin">Eſth. 4.13, 14</note>.</p>

                     <p>He loveth <hi>ad arcas, non ad aras,</hi> as farre as the cheſt, but not as the Altar, as for matter of Religion he can eaſily ſtep over that block; the only thing that ſtops the courſe of his friendſhip, and breaks the league of love, is reſpect to his own gain and profit. And if Religion can be brought within that compaſſe of his gaine, then he cries up Religion with all his throat; and then, <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for alters and gaine both meeting together, he will be as mad as <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his fellows for <hi>Diana of the Epheſians</hi>

If his friend prove to be his corrival in love (yea, in luſt) his competitor in honour, his partner in profit, theſe are like the pillar of <hi>Hercules,</hi> beyond which, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall never move.

                     <p>If his friend be never ſo diſhoneſt, that breaks no friendſhip, ſo long as he beares up his port, and thriveth in the world: for he that choſe him to be his friend, not for his honeſty, but in hope to gaine by him, will not forſake him for diſhoneſty, ſo long as there is hope of profit.

He chooſeth not his friend for wealth, or for proſperity, or for any unworthy ends of his own, theſe things therefore being removed, cannot put a period to his love which had no hand in the beginning of it. It was honeſty, piety, wiſdome, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diſpoſition that drew on his love to ſmite a league of friendſhip at the firſt; and while theſe remaine he cannot ceaſe to love. Adverſity doth not take away, but rather ſcoure off the ruſt that by long proſperity perhaps is gotten into them: So that he is never better, nor ſcarce ſo good a friend and companion, as when he is at the loweſt. If then he need more help, he will deſerve it; for then is he in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frame of ſpirit to be helpful to his friend, eſpecially in the choiceſt acts of true godly friendſhip, then ever he was before. Therefore as it is the true touchſtone of friendſhip, ſo it is the property of every truly Chriſtian friend, ſo farre to purſue his own intereſt, to be a companion without envy in proſperity, and without wearineſſe in adverſity; to ſtick to his friend in danger, but never in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7</note>.

                     </p>
                     <p>He knoweth that never were friends ſo well ſorted and ſuited, but that there would be ſomething unſuited, making each burdenſome to the other, and requiring not only patience, but wiſdome to <hi>bear one anothers burdens</hi> if ever they mean to <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law of Christ</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 6.2</note>. They muſt provide ſhoulders to bear, as well as hands to aſſiſt, and bear what cannot be avoided, if they will do as they would be done unto.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63232:181"/> They caſt this before hand, and expect it, although they do what they can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. This, people who are wiſe, prepare for, and buckle to, even in the neereſt and deareſt bond of love, marriage it ſelf; yea, even in <hi>marriage in the Lord;</hi> they <hi>ſhall have trouble in the fleſh.</hi> And therefore however it be a mans wiſdom ſo to love a friend, as one that poſſibly may prove an enemy, yet it is his care to do whatever he may to prevent it on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>He entreth into friendſhip with the denial of himſelf, and of his friend too if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate and fall off from piety and honeſty. And he ſo carrieth himſelf in friendſhip, that if his friend prove an enemy, he may have no ſuch advantage againſt him as to lie at his mercy, as knowing there is no hatred like friendſhip turn'd into enmity. Therefore he takes out that leſſon, <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the door of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy boſome</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Micah 7.5</note>. Somethings are not to be told to friends by him that is a friend to himſelf. He accounts it a folly to commit himſelf to the power and danger of another, where he may avoid it. Chriſt himſelf would not do it<note n="d" place="margin">John 2.24</note>, becauſe he knew the danger. A Chriſtian therefore ſhould ſhun it the more, becauſe Chriſt himſelf, who was ignorant of nothing, ſhunned it ſo much. For hereby whether he be compelled to hate where now he loveth, or be forſaken of his friend whom he deſireth ſtill to love, he is ſtill on ſure ground, not to forfeit himſelf to the hatred of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like ſome ſworne brothers that engage to live and die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet in the turning of an hand, or for the wagging of a feather turne mortal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; the true Chriſtian is to his friend what <hi>Paul</hi> (upon better grounds) was to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who <hi>were in his heart to live and die with them,</hi> and ſo continued<note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.3</note>: the one is as <hi>Laban</hi> quarrelling with <hi>Jacob</hi> more for carrying away his <hi>idols,</hi> then his <hi>daughters</hi>

                     <p>He is <hi>amicus à voluptatibus,</hi> a friend meerly upon the account of pleaſures, pleaſe his palate, or other luſt, and you have him body and ſoul.

                        </gap>, a bitter-ſweet. It hath not only ſweet-meats, but pills; coroſives as well as healing playſters. It can wound as well as heal; yea, it muſt wound, that it may heal, <hi>The blewneſſe of the wound clenſeth away evil</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 20.30</note>. He muſt ſometimes beat his friend, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his own body;<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27</note>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites friendſhip is like <hi>the kiſſes of an enemy,</hi> which <hi>are deceitful</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 27.6</note>; the friendſhip of a Chriſtian is like <hi>the wounds of a friend,</hi> which <hi>are faithful;</hi> the one is a baud, the other, a Phyſician.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hyprocrite is a friend more for profit then for friendſhip.</hi>

                     <p>True friendſhip conſiſteth not ſo much in praiſing or hugging, as in bettering a friend. But he that is himſelf evil, cares not to have any man better. If he can turne friendſhip to the account of profit, he will be any mans ſervant that will ſerve him in this way, let his profitable friend be as wicked as he will, <hi>mali non gaudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, niſi propter utile.</hi> It is profit that links evil men together. <hi>Who will ſhew us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Pſalme 4.6</note>? is the grand enquiry of ſuch men, but they account nothing good, but what fills the purſe. Such friends are like cheating gameſters that play no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then each can hope to get victory over the other in cheating. This hypocrite is ſuch a gameſter, a friend to any man by whom he may get: to none, by whom he is likely to loſe.</p>
                     <p>The very forme of his friend is a contract for gain. Help me, and I will help thee; ſerve my turne and I will ſerve thine, is the great Covenant between them. If he can convert the dead mans Apothegme (<hi>hodie mihi cras tibi,</hi> what to day is to me, to morrow ſhall be to thee,) to his own profit while he lives, he embraceth a friend with all his heart; only he is careful to ride the fore-horſe; his turne is to be firſt ſerved, <hi>to day, to me.</hi> And, in this account he is <hi>your ſervant for ever;</hi> meaſuring <hi>for ever,</hi> by profit, not by yeares.</p>
                     <p>In caſes of judgement and juſtice, if this hypocrite eſpy a <hi>Legion of Angels</hi> (good ſtore of gold) coming towards him, he muſt needs <hi>fall down and worſhip;</hi> and if not the cauſe, but the perſon; bribery, perjury and all unrighteouſneſſe get the day, you muſt not blame him: for he was as buſie when your cauſe was in hearing, as ever <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Lot</hi> were in entertaining of a far leſſe number of better <hi>Angels.</hi> Nay, he will play at ſmall game, rather then ſit out. If he be a man for gaine, he will reſpect perſons as they reſpect him; and, <hi>for a piece of bread that man will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 28.21</note>; yea, he ſhall <hi>pollute God himſelf</hi> by any kinde of injuſtice, <hi>for handfuls of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and pieces of bread</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 13.19</note>. This makes him that could be content in regard of his own diſpoſition to do juſtice, to alter his minde for a corrupting friend, unleſſe the other ſide ſet him right again by a greater gift. While profit bindeth, he is faſt enough: when that faileth, or runs quicker through another pipe, he and his friend fall aſunder; but if profit turne to the other ſide, he is an utter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the true Chriſtian is a friend more for vertue then for profit; yea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue againſt profit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that is himſelf good (as every man who is a true friend, muſt be) looks more at goodneſſe then profit; at godlineſſe more then at gaine. If he can put his friend in a way of profit, he rejoyceth; but if gaine and goodneſſe will not walk together, he leaveth gain to follow goodneſſe; and this he preferreth to his friend before gain. He commends goodneſſe to him as the chief commodity; and gaine but as the ſweepings of the market. And while the hypocrite ſuppoſeth <hi>gain to be godlineſſe</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.5</note>; he on the contrary, findeth and commendeth <hi>godlineſſe to be the greateſt gain</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Verſe 6.</note>. For this he is a friend; and, herein, he will moſtly <hi>ſhew himſelf friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he ſee his friend apt to contention, he will endeavour to put out that fire by caſting upon it this water, <hi>why do you not ſuffer your ſelf rather to be defrauded</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.7.</note>; than to be quarrelſome? And although this be ſtrange, counſel in contentious days, yet he cannot take himſelf to be a true friend, if he give not counſel to his friend to be in ſome things a loſer, that he may be a gainer in his peace, and more Chriſtianly diſpoſed in his heart. He never was true friend to his neighbour that endeavours
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63232:182"/> not to make peace between neighbours, if either will heare him as a <hi>Counſellor of peace</hi>

This hypocrite hath him now where he would have him, and as he would have him, to chooſe. Let him now deny him any thing, or not be ſtill heaping favours upon him, if he dares. His care is to keep himſelf blameleſſe, and not his friend. Therefore he ſo obſerves, as if he took no notice; or, ſo takes notice, as if he meant to be ſecret, and tender of his friends reputation.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe, he notes them as carefully, captiouſly and maliciouſly as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although it be yet no time to take notice of them; for a while, he muſt laugh in his ſleeve. If he ſpeak of it, it is in private behinde his back, where he thinks the other ſhall not heare of it, to make himſelfe merry with the infirmities of his friend. But when he hath no more uſe or need of his friendſhip, and can gaine by him no longer, then he bolteth out at once all his friends frailties and his own venome together, inſulting over him whom before he ſeemed to adore. Then it appeares what uſe he made of his familiarity; namely, to lay a ground to contemn him and tyranniſe over him, and to lay open his ſhame to make him odious to others, when he ceaſeth to be beneficial to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>He is firſt a <hi>flatterer,</hi> and then a <hi>tale-carrier</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Prov. 20.19</note>. He is perhaps the firſt tempter of his friend to evil, as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was of <hi>Abſalom</hi> to that inceſt with <hi>his fathers Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> which till adviſed to it, he perhaps never dreamt of, and he had at that time, other matters of more concernment, then ſuch wanton wickedneſſe to think upon. Or, if he tempt not to it, yet he flattereth him in it; or at leaſt concealeth his knowledge of it, keeping his friend hood-winkt from a true ſight of his own faults whereby he might mend them; but will not long keep them from others who will deſpiſe his friend for them. Yea, therefore he refuſeth to hold the glaſſe to thee, that he may when he ſeeth his time, and when thy wickedneſſe is riper, hold forth a picture of thy deformities to others; for, a flatterer will ſurely prove a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</p>
                     <p>He that flattereth thee to thy face, will ſlander thee when thy back is turned. He that will hide thee from thy ſelf, will diſplay thee to others. He that ſeeth his friends face fowle, and will not tell him of it, ſheweth that he meanes it ſhould not be made clean till others have noted it, and made ſome ſport with it; and therefore will not ſpeak of it, leſt it ſhould be mended.</p>
                     <p>He that is ſuch a flatterer is alſo a wanderer, thruſting into every company to hear and tell news; and to make himſelf more acceptable, he begins with a ſtory of thee. <hi>He goeth about as a tale-bearer, revealing ſecrets</hi>

He that doth thus, uſually traduceth others firſt unto thee, eſpecially if he diſcerne that thou loveſt them not, and loveſt to heare tales of others. But, he that makes bold with other mens names unto thee, will deal thee the ſame meaſure when he is with others. And he that proſtituteth all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends to thy ſcorn, that he may flatter and pleaſe thee, will put thee in the ſame
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63232:182"/> number and condition, to gratifie another. For he cares for no more but one friend at a time, and that is the party preſent.</p>

                     <p>It is not more incident to the <hi>tale-bearer</hi> to <hi>reveal ſecrets,</hi> then it is proper to <hi>him that is of a faithful ſpirit, to conceal the matter</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 11.13</note>. He knoweth his own infirmities, and how ill he ſhould hear in the world, if others ſhould blazon him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his beſt care to reforme what he can. Therefore he will not ſee all, but wink at ſmall faults in his friend, he pryeth not curiouſly, nor interpreteth captiouſly, all that he cannot but ſee. He is content to be ignorant of what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amend in his friend, love maketh him content to be blinde in his friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſo long as his friend be not too much prejudiced by it.

No more will he ſee evil in his friend, to upbraid him with it, or to expoſe him to ſhame. What he ſeeth, it is to cover and amend it: Not to reproach his friend but to adviſe and counſel him better.</p>
                     <p>When he muſt ſpeak of it, it is to himſelf, not unto others; ſo long at leaſt as there is any hope that his friend <hi>will hear</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 18.15</note>, and <hi>hear him</hi> ſo, that he ſhall not need to call witneſſes of the admonition<note n="f" place="margin">verſe 16</note>.

He holdeth a true glaſſe to his friend, but draweth a curtaine before his picture. He maketh it one and the ſame point of friendſhip lovingly to reprove a friend to his face, that he may be benefited, not reproached; and to praiſe him behinde his back, that he may be encouraged, not puffed up.</p>
                     <p>And even when he hath no longer need of his friend; nay, when there is no longer friendſhip, nor his friend himſelf no longer living to take offence; yet then he throws not off his friend as caſt-rags to the dung-hill, but ſo doth he honour the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Sepulchre of his old friendſhip, that what was good in his friend, he is careful to publiſh it for imitation, and is aſhamed to diſcover the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of him that was once his friend, although perhaps too guilty of too much evil.</p>

                     <p>He muſt not have too much in-ſight, fore-ſight, judgement, conſtancy in him, with whom this man joynes in amity, for ſuch a man skareth away both flatterers and them that love to be flattered, unleſſe he be withall ſo facile, or at leaſt ſo ſelf-ended, that he may be made a knave at pleaſure.

                     </p>
                     <p>He may be deceived in his judgement, but his choice ſhall follow the beſt judgement he hath upon the ſtricteſt enquiry. He would have him ſtayed, not fickle; judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, not ſelf-conceited; grave, not auſtere; becauſe he findeth too much auſterity an enemy to ſociety; therefore, to friendſhip, which without ſociableneſſe is a paine, not a pleaſure; a vexation, not a commodity. In ſome caſes he will deale with his friend as the nurſe in playing with her childe; being, and doing any thing to content him at preſent; yet, with intent, by degrees to weane him from his childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>The Chriſtian therfore layeth two things in the ballance at once; <hi>auſterity</hi> in the one ſcale, and lightneſſe or <hi>facility</hi> in the other; but finding both too light, pitcheth upon a mean between them, wherein vertue conſiſteth. Auſterity he findes to be a churle to friendſhip; and, lightneſſe or unſtayedneſſe an enemy to vertue, which of the two, to a good man is moſt diſtaſtful. Therefore his choice runneth upon gravity without auſterity; wiſdome, without ſelf-conceitedneſſe; conſtancy, without unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledneſſe; affability, without lightneſſe; ſociableneſſe, without vanity; faithfulneſs, without hypocriſie. And at length pitcheth upon this above all the reſt, <hi>Let him love me leſſe, ſo he love God more</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like wormes that grow ſooneſt in ſweeteſt woods; the true Chriſtian is like the choiceſt flowers that delight to be only in the beſt manured gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; the one loves to be fiſhing where moſt will bite at his bait; the other, where only ſuch take the hook, as are beſt worth the taking.</p>

                     <p>He likes no man longer than he is for his turne. If a new friend be better for his uſe, he knows how to be rid of the old. He is for a market, not for keeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commodity longer, then till he can make moſt of it. Moſt men commend houſes and garments; ſo doth he friends, for the newneſſe, and faſhion. He is as much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ſeen with his fathers friend, if out of date; as, to be ſeen in his fathers cloaths. Every new thing pleaſeth vaine mindes to whom nothing is welcome, but that which is new come; and if the old ſubſtance remaine, yet it muſt be put into the new faſhion. So muſt his friends, if they will have the continuance of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He being vaine and various himſelf, expects that his friends ſhould not be as pillars, while himſelf is a weather-cock. If the winde turne with him, and force him from his former reſolutions and courſes, his friend muſt turne too, or be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of doores.

                        <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 27.10</note>. He chooſeth friends, as men chooſe wine, by age and continuance<note n="l" place="margin">Luke 5.39</note>. If he be forced to caſt off an old friend, it is becauſe his friend hath firſt caſt off friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as <hi>David</hi> caſt off a <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> either willingly, when he proved unworthy, and turned rebel; or, unwillingly, becauſe the other would be held on no longer. No man can hold that which will not ſtay. But, whether willingly, or unwillingly, he doth it not out of lightneſſe of diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Friendſhip is not a Covenant for a time, but a league for ever, between thoſe that are good. He therefore parteth with his friend as with his blood, which he never lets out but in extreame neceſſity. And his friend is rather rent, then ript from him. Their parting is rather a violence offered by the other, then a ſurceaſe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63232:183" rendition="simple:additions"/> of affection in him. He mourns after him, when he hath loſt him, as a man mourneth for his ſonne that is dead; and is more afraid, then deſirous of a new friend in room of the old, leſt the new prove worſe then the old. He likes nothing new, but <hi>the new creature,</hi> and that is moſt welcome in an old friend of whom he hath moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites friendſhip is as the ſowing of two peeces of cloth together, which, if the thread of profit, or other intereſt faileth, the peeces fall aſunder of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the true Chriſtian is as cloth torne aſunder, when he is deprived of his friend againſt his will: the one is fickle, and therefore affects variety; the other is ſtable, and therefore deſires perpetuity: the one is for a new friend, being yet to begin friendſhip; the other is ſetled in that courſe already, and therefore loves the old.</p>

By <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> he underſtandeth a particular enumeration of all ſinnes in the eares of a Prieſt: By <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> a valuable recompence made to the juſtice of God for the offence of ſinne. But in all this there is a double hypocriſie and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>One, in requiring no more in ſaving repentance then what may and hath been done by a reprobate. <hi>Judas</hi> ſhewed all theſe: <hi>Contrition</hi> or attrition at leaſt, being ſo much affected and dejected for betraying innocent blood, that he could not but confeſſe his offence to thoſe very Prieſts that had corrupted him to do it, and made <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> too, for he brought the whole money back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and threw it at their feet, when they refuſed otherwiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                     <p>The other errour or hypocriſie is, in miſtaking the very things which he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be requiſite unto Repentance. For, his <hi>contrition</hi> is only legal, without faith apprehending mercy and pardon. His <hi>confeſſion</hi> required is only unto man, which of neceſſity is no where enjoyned to be made to man (eſpecially if the ſins be ſecret, as for the moſt part, this hypocrites are) but unto God, where his name and Goſpel are not openly violated and blaſphemed. And, his <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be made unto God, which is impoſſible; whereas the ſatisfaction that God requires us
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63232:184"/> to make in perſon, is only to man whom we have wronged. In this laſt lies the greateſt part of Popiſh repentance, in which, if ſatisfaction be made, by giving ſome large gobbet to ſome <hi>Covent</hi> or <hi>Religious Houſe,</hi> (as they ſtile their <hi>Cages of unclean birds</hi>) or to the Church, (which they call ſatisfaction made to God) this is enough to expiate the ſins of the penitentiary, even in the Court of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; although the parties wronged and oppreſſed by him (whereby he is enabled to give this great gift) be not at all ſatisfied or conſidered. Yea, this <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> if made by a Son, a Grandchilde, Nephew, any body, in behalf of any ſinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, is held enough to redeem his ſoule out of Purgatory, who hath layen there long, and died without ſuch repentance, having wherewithal ſo to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie.</p>

                     <p>He looketh upon ſin as a forſaking of the Creator for the ſervice of the creature, yea, of baſe luſts as bad as the devil; therefore his repentance conſiſteth of an averſion from evil, and converſion to God. He putteth off the old man by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and putteth on the new man by vivification; in which he findeth faith in the firſt place to be moſt requiſite, as the fountain of true Evangelical repentance, becauſe he well underſtandeth, that <hi>by faith</hi> God himſelf <hi>purifieth the heart.</hi> And as for <hi>Contrition, Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> although in the Romiſh ſenſe, (wherein they are made a meer trade to get money) he cannot allow them; yet, in a true ſenſe he admitteth them not as proper parts; yet ſometimes as <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,</hi> ſometimes as <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> ſometimes as <hi>Concomitants,</hi> ſometimes as <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of the grace of Repentance in Gods children.</p>

                     <p>As for <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> wherein he hath offended God, he caſteth himſelf upon the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt: but, wherein he hath offended man, he acknowledgeth
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63232:185"/> it to be his duty, and makes it his endeavour to give ſatisfaction. If he hath falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſed any man, and thereby pilled him, he maketh reſtitution<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 19.8</note>. If he hath weakned or ſcandalized the Church, he endeavoureth ſatisfaction by his earneſt prayer, that ſhe may be healed by his exemplary repentance, of that wound ſhe received by his fall<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 51.18</note>.

To view his ſpecial ſins would be too troubleſom, and make him too much out of love with himſelf, which of all things the hypocrite can leaſt endure. He is content to look what good wares he hath in his ſhop; and there, with the Phariſee<note n="p" place="margin">Luke 18.</note>, he will be as particular as he can, even unto falſe boaſting; he will tell a faire tale for himſelf, how juſt, chaſte, devout, conſcientious in <hi>tything, &amp;c.</hi> he is.

                     <p>Therefore he hateth both Miniſter and Miniſtry, that is too buſie in turning over his debt-book, or calling too haſtily to make ſatisfaction; he cannot endure him that is daily bringing in new bills, and calling for payment. He is as a man that hath an ill face, that would not be known. He is content to look upon his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but loth to view himſelf in a clear and true glaſſe. He likes not that you ſhould draw his picture, but he is content to give you one of his own drawing. He commends that preaching that makes all men look of the ſame hue and faſhion, although perhaps it be unpleaſing and uncomfortable enough: that ſpeaketh againſt ſin in the general, and againſt the devil in particular, but not againſt pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, if he be guilty: nor putting his finger in his ſore, and teaching him to repent of his wickedneſſe in particular, telling him, <hi>thou art the man</hi>

                     <p>If he muſt needs look into his own ſins, it is but a confuſed ſight he takes of them; he will not pore too much or too long on ſuch an unpleaſing object, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to repenting of them. It may fall out that he may be troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and poſſeſſed with ſome melancholy fit or fright, which may force him to a dull and ſudden glance of his eye upon his ſin, ſeeing his ſins, as the man that <hi>ſaw men like trees</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Mar. 8.24</note>. Or, he may be troubled with ſome ſins which are indeed no ſins, neglecting true and proper ſins; making great ſhew of looking earneſtly and ſadly upon ſin where there is no cauſe, and over-looking that which is true cauſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as he that vieweth himſelf in a troubled water, may conceive he hath a wry mouth, at which he is troubled; but never looks at the ſpots in his face, for which he hath more cauſe of trouble; he hardly eſpieth a ſcarre, a true blemiſh or wrinkle, of which his face is full. He loves not to be too plainly dealt with, or to have his ſins made too plain and palpable. He will take a curſory view of his ſins, and accordingly performeth a curſory repentance, whereupon he demandeth a pardon of courſe; being contented with any comfort, although not applied to the purpoſe.</p>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 51.3</note>. And if he doth not know them fully, he crieth out unto God, <hi>How many are mine iniquities and ſins, make me to know My tranſgreſſion, and My ſin</hi>

                     <p>He is far from the bankrupts humour, that cannot endure to look narrowly and particularly into his eſtate; but, rather goes beyond all others in caſting up of his debts, as knowing he hath one Creditor that will not be fob'd, by concealing or denying the debt. He not only particularly enumerates his ſins, but ſingles out his ſpecial ſin from the reſt, and purſueth that moſt eagerly beyond all the reſt. <hi>I have done this evil in thy ſight</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 51.4</note>. And at length he comes to the very core, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

                        <note n="w" place="margin">Ver. 14.</note>. His repentance pointeth at the very boyle and ſoreſt part of the ſpecial ſin; not omitting others, but inſiſting chiefly on this? as thoſe Iſraelites, making confeſſion to <hi>Samuel</hi> of their folly in deſiring of <hi>Saul, we have added unto all our ſins, this evil, to ask us a King</hi>

                     <p>Thus this hypocrite in reſpect of his beloved ſin, is as loth to be known of it, as <hi>Cain</hi> was to confeſſe what was become of his brother<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 4.9.</note>; the true Chriſtian is as willing to lay open his boſome-ſin, as <hi>Shechaniah</hi> in behalf of thoſe Jewes who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their ſpecial wickedneſſe, <hi>We have treſpaſſed against our God, and have taken ſtrange wives</hi>

                     <p>He hateth ſin,<note place="margin">Hatred of ſin.</note> not out of goodneſſe, but rather out of indiſpoſition to ſome particulars. Some ſins are ſo diſagreeable to his nature and temper, as ſtrong drink is to ſome complexions, that he cares not much for any ſin that the world cries out upon; as he that hates the Maſter of a family, can brook none that dwell in it. He hateth ſin, as ſome of a cold complexion, or from ſome natural infirmity and imperfection; or, out of ſcorne, not grace, hate uncleanneſſe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and none ſo eager as they againſt thoſe who through frailty fall in that kind: yea, they are tranſported againſt things lawful; as, againſt marriage, or at leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſecond marriage, although allowed by God and by his Virgin-Apoſtle<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.39.</note> So, he hateth prodigality, himſelf being moſt gripple and tenacious.

Or, of all things he hateth indiſcreet zeal, becauſe himſelf is very cold and frozen in the dregs of his ſin. In a word, 'tis an eaſie matter to hate that ſin ſecurely, which he either feeles not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or feareth not an aptneſſe or ſtrength to fall into.</p>
                     <p>He therefore hateth ſome ſins, but not <hi>all:</hi> he hateth what he likes not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commit: but not other ſins which ſuit better with him, and for which he hath opportunity. In a general way, he may hate ſin, as it is an enemie to Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not upon a ſpiritual account, as contrary to God; as a moral Heathen, not as a Citizen in Heaven. He hates ſin in the general, not in particular, at leaſt not in that particular which he ſhould. He hovereth, as the Swallow that makes many offers, but never lighteth. And ſo, while he hates not all, even the whole body of ſin, he hates none at all: yea, he hateth none, becauſe he hateth not ſome, ſpecially; and, all the reſt, the worſe for that.</p>
                     <p>He hateth ſin in other men rather then in himſelf. He hateth them the more in others, becauſe he favoureth no man but himſelf. In his enemy he hateth them moſt, becauſe under colour of zeal againſt ſin, he may revenge his own quarrel to the utmoſt. There is an humane, and partial hatred even of ſin, yea, diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal alſo: when men are willing to take into other mens dunghils, as glad to ſee ſin, that they may hate the ſinner, not the ſin: diſgrace the perſon, not mourn for the wickedneſſe, and glad to ſee evil in thoſe whom they would have a pretence to abhorre.</p>

                     <p>He abhorreth all ſin as oppoſite to Gods Nature, as well as a tranſgreſſion of his Law; for Gods ſake, more then his own. And to give a certain teſtimony of the truth of his repentance, he abhorreth that ſin moſt, which without grace, is moſt agreeable to his conſtitution and temper, and to which he hath moſt opportunity. His love to God makes him to look upon all ſinnes, as the greateſt enemies to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice; and, hating himſelf for ſin, he ſeeth ſuch ſins as being the firſt-borne,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63232:186"/> and as it were the darlings of his corruption. Therefore he is more milde to others in thoſe ſins whereto he is not tempted himſelf, looking on them as more capable of excuſe, becauſe they have more tentation; and, in thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he is, or may be tempted, he deals the more tenderly with others, as being privy to his own frailty.

                     <p>He hath an hard heart of his own to tug withal, and that he feeleth to his grief, more then he can the hearts of other men.

                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtians ſorrow for ſin, is deeply drawn out of the Well of an humbled heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He brings not out a tear, but he dives to the bottom of his heart for it. His ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row aſcends from his heart to the eye, and from his eye returnes to his heart, as the water of a fountain from the top of the pipes falls back into the ſame place whence it ſprang up. His ſorrow not only riſeth thence, but ſettles there. He cares not for witneſſes of his teares, unleſſe where there be witneſſes too many of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. <hi>Ille dolet verè qui ſine teſte dolet.</hi> Sorrow the more ſincere, the more ſecret. He had rather, with <hi>Peter,</hi> go out from the company, and weep in private, then perſonate a Mourner in their Congregation. Where the ſpirit of ſupplication and mourning is beſtowed, not only each family, but each perſon <hi>mourneth apart,</hi> not ſo much as their wives in company with them. He ſeeth him that is inviſible, and knoweth that the inviſible God ſeeth him and putteth all his tears into his bottle<note n="p" place="margin">Zech. 12.12</note>, which to him is enough.</p>
                     <p>And the more private his ſorrow, the deeper it is. Sometimes it is like <hi>the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 56.8</note>, the place where <hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſlain, for whoſe death the people made publick and bitter lamentations; ſometimes even in private, he <hi>maketh his bed to ſwim in the night</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">2 Chro. 35.25</note>; and even in the day, <hi>he watereth his couch with his teares.</hi> Not that a Chriſtian repenting, doth alwayes neceſſarily weep: ſome are naturally ſo dry-eyed that they cannot ſhed a tear, even to ſave their lives. Therefore not the teares, but the heart affected, as ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in teares, is to be heeded. Sorrow for ſin lies more at the heart, then in the eye. Yea, ſometimes he is ſo overwhelmed with grief, that he cannot weep, as a veſſel without vent cannot run, yet give a little aire of comfort, and then both heart and eyes will melt, and be diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>Poſſibly he may (which is his trouble) mourn more feelingly for outward loſſes and croſſes then for ſin; becauſe, in worldly grief he hath the help of nature and affections near at hand, even while nature is an enemy to godly ſorrow; yet he ſorroweth not more truly, deeply, or reſolvedly. And the meaſure of ſorrow is to be taken by the underſtanding and judgement, not by ſenſe: by will, not by affection. Sorrow is a great part of this Chriſtians ſacrifice which muſt be rational, or reaſonable<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 12.1</note>. We ſee a wiſe man to ſorrow more feelingly for the loſs of an horſe, an hawk, a dog, or ſome matter of pleaſure, then of an adventure by ſea, or of a ſuit at Law of far greater importance; yet, in his judgement, he eſteemeth the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a far greater loſſe; which he would much rather have eſcaped. So is it here.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:63232:187"/> 
                        <hi>David</hi> mourned more feelingly for <hi>Abſalom</hi> the ſon of his delight, then for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> the ſubject of his ſin. And who would equal childrens tears to the ſorrows of men, yet thoſe are more feeling and affectionate then theſe. The Chriſtian mourneth more underſtandingly and ſolidly, with more intention of heart, although not ſo ſenſibly in affection. He eſteemeth the <hi>Premunire,</hi> or out-lawry of Gods diſpleaſure, to be more bitter then all miſeries of life: yea, he accounteth himſelf to be thereby in a worſe caſe, (till God ſpeak peace) then to be unborn, therefore ſorrow for ſin makes a deeper wound inwardly, then that which bleeds more outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Thus this hypocrites teares are like the harlots ſmiles or flatteries; (only with this difference, that ſhe hath to do with a fool that is willingly beguiled by her, the hypocrite hath to do with a God that will not be deluded by him:) the true Chriſtians ſorrow is like <hi>Iſrael</hi> truly repenting, <hi>when they drew water, and poured it out before the Lord</hi>

Such is this pliant hypocrite: his ſorrow, like that of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was a ſhort qualm, or fit like a ſea-ſickneſſe, ſoon over; if he once but ſmel land he recovereth.

                     <p>And no marvel; for the hypocrite in his ſorrow is a meer Patient: as a man that is ſick againſt his will; or melancholy, and cannot help it.

He can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in raine, as well, as in the ſhining of the Sun: and taketh comfort in godly ſorrow, as a man doth in ſure phyſick, even when it makes him ſickeſt, becauſe he is aſſured from Chriſt himſelf of the bleſſing of joy upon ſuch a watering<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 5.4</note>.

                     <p>This hypocrite is in his ſorrow, as in all other things, for himſelf. Self-love and hypocriſie cannot be ſevered. We ſorrow for nothing but what is hurtful to that we love. What a man apprehendeth to be moſt hurtful to that he loves beſt, he is moſt grieved for, when it lights upon that object of his love. If it fall any where elſe, it never troubleth him. This hypocrite loving himſelf beſt, and God leaſt, yea, not at all; can never be truly ſorrowful for any thing, but as it falls upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let God ſuffer never ſo much, this hypocrite is not moved with it. He ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth neither with God, nor for God.</p>
                     <p>He is no friend to God in his ſorrowing, nor God to him. He mourneth not for God, neither doth God bemoan him. He ſorroweth both profanely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately. Profanely, for he runneth from God, as <hi>Cain, to the land of Nod</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 4.16</note>, as <hi>Saul,</hi> to the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi>

He firſt begins haſtily with carnal joy, and therefore is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards juſtly ſwallowed up of overmuch heavineſſe and horrour. He would not offer unto God an heart contrite for ſin, his ſpirit muſt at length lie down in ſorrow of heart as a puniſhment for ſinne<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 16.25</note>; his faith was of his own making, without repentance, and this endeth in a repentance of his own, without faith.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the Chriſtian ſorroweth with reſpect to God,</hi>

                     <p>His ſorrow is more for God then for himſelf, more, for that <hi>God is broken by his whoriſh heart, that hath departed from him</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 6.9</note>: then that God hath broken him for that departure. His ſorrow alſo is <hi>a godly ſorrow,</hi> being <hi>made ſorry after a godly manner,</hi> and thereby it comes to paſſe that <hi>he receives damage in nothing</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.9</note>. <hi>A ſorrow that worketh repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of;</hi> not <hi>the ſorrow of the world,</hi> which <hi>worketh death:</hi> A ſorrow wrought by God, not by terrours of the devil; a ſorrow that drives him unto God, not from him; that makes him to lie at Gods feet to do what he will with him; caſting himſelf wholly on God to heal his broken heart, and to bind up his wounds.</p>
                     <p>And as he reſpecteth God in his ſorrow, ſo the Lord comforteth him. His ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row therefore is moderated, not in regard of his diſpleaſure againſt the ſin which he hath committed; but in regard of the comforts of the Goſpel with which it is mixed. It makes him ſo to <hi>draw near unto God</hi> who hath ſmitten him, that God thereupon <hi>draws near unto him</hi> to heal him<note n="m" place="margin">Jam. 4.8</note>. And it ſo humbleth him, that God exalteth him. The hypocrite and the Chriſtian may be ſick of the ſame diſeaſe, and ſore of the ſame wound, but the hypocrite hath the pangs of conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort; the diſeaſe, without the remedy; the wound, without the cure; but the true Chriſtian hath a merciful Father, a powerful Phyſician, that not only ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, but comforteth him; and healeth as well as woundeth him<note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 57.19</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is a man wounded in warre, which makes him flie ſo far as he can from him that fell upon him; the Chriſtian is as he that being lanced by the Chyrurgion, puts himſelf further under his hand, to binde up and heal the wound which he hath made: the one when ſorrow ſeiſeth on him, is as <hi>Nabal,</hi> thunder-ſmitten, that he dies away like a ſtone<note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.37</note>; the other, is as they who were <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> at the preaching of <hi>Peter</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He ſometimes feigneth a ſorrow that he might not be thought to come behind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in repentance. But that makes him never the better penitent, but rather the worſe; becauſe he ſo much pleaſeth himſelf with his mock-ſorrow, or with that which is not to the purpoſe, that he never looks after that which is true, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. He aimeth aloof at ſome petty ſins, or ſuch as are common to him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but never comes near to the ſpecial and chief cauſe of controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his ſoule. As the Lapwing crieth fartheſt from his neſt, ſo he makes moſt ado and complaint of thoſe things, for which he hath leaſt cauſe to be troubled; in the mean time ſuffereth a far greater wickedneſſe to ſleep in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, without the leaſt diſturbance or notice taken of it. So that he ſets up his ſorrow but as a blinde, to keep men off from eſpying his beloved ſin, and from all ſuſpition of his being guilty of harbouring ſuch a viper.</p>
                     <p>And whether his ſorrow be feigned or true, little or much, he is not ſoftened or humbled by it, but rather hardened the more. His heart is as an Anvil, or armour of proof, that is not mollified, but either more hard, or broken to peeces, never to be capable of ſetting together again. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by every plague or hand of God upon him, he becomes more ſtiffe, and unmalleable. <hi>Abigail</hi> told <hi>Nabal</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have drawn from him a flood of teares; but his heart, hardened in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe before<note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.3</note>, was ſo far from melting, that it <hi>died within him, and he became as a ſtone</hi>

                     <p>He applieth the plaiſter to the right ſore, and putteth the tent of repentance in to the true wound. This ſorrow he <hi>poureth out like water, his heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of his bowels</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 22.14</note>. If he hear any ſad newes of his own heart, upon hearing the words of the Law, that draweth ſorrow from him, that ſorrow is a ſoftening, melting, diſſolving ſorrow.

                     <p>He is not regardleſſe of his own reputation, where he may maintain it without diſhonour to God: but, where his credit and Gods honour come in competition, he diſdaineth the congreſſe, and will maintain Gods honour even againſt his own; for, God is dearer to him then all the world, yea, then his own ſelf.

Wonderful is the ingenuity of a Saint; he will rather record his own ſhame, that God may have honour, then conceal his own ſin, to maintain his own credit againſt God. If <hi>Moſes</hi> offend through paſſion and <hi>unbelief</hi> but once in his life, he will record it, although to his own ſhame, that God may not ſuffer by cauſing a man of ſo great deſert as <hi>Moſes</hi> to loſe the honour of bringing them into <hi>Canaan</hi> whom he led out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from whom he endured ſo much hardſhip in the wilderneſſe<note n="z" place="margin">Numb. 20.12</note>.

He will uſe it ſo far forth as it is ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, without prejudice to his fidelity to God; but for the reſt he will hold it as with bit and bridle, leſt having the reines of his heart it turn upon him; or he will keep it at ſtaves end for fear of a <hi>Judas</hi> his kiſſe. For well he knoweth it to be vain, and therefore not to be eſteemed; treacherous, therefore not to be truſted; evil, through the common abuſe, therefore not to be loved.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite fights againſt the world, as ſome Netherlanders were wont to fight with the Spaniard; when the Spaniard fell upon him in the field, or at ſea, in an hoſtile way, the Netherlander would ſtrenuouſly oppoſe him; but at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time ſell him armes and ammunition, if he brought money in his hand; the true Chriſtian fights with the world, as <hi>Benhadad</hi> gave command to his officers, who told him of the <hi>young men that came out of Samaria</hi> towards his Camp, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be come out for peace, or for warre, take them alive</hi>

                     <p>The fleſh being neareſt, is the moſt dangerous enemy of all; for, in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> both the world and the devil do continually wage warre. Theſe two make the invaſion, but can do no miſchief further then they hold correſpondence with, and receive intelligence and aſſiſtance from the fleſh within. Thence they get all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which they make uſe of. Here therefore, both the hypocrite, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian have moſt to do, as will appear not only in this Character, but in ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther following.</p>
                     <p>And here firſt, this hypocrite fights with his ſhadow in ſtead of the ſubſtance; he ſets up a ſhaw-fowle of his owne, and then ſhoots at it; or rather, fighteth with a friend in ſtead of an enemy: with the ſubſtance of his natural body, in ſtead of the corrupt qualities of ſin in the whole man, which make up the body of ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him: for, if he be ſuperſtitiouſly addicted and ambitious to merit, he thinks there is no other combate with the fleſh required, then to macerate and ſtarve his natural fleſh, to wit, his outward man; or, to wound it by whipping and other unrequired and unwarrantable hardſhip, until he hath by this <hi>ſhew of wiſdom</hi> and Religion, in the <hi>neglecting</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Col. 2.23</note>, and diſhonouring of the body, made it unſerviceable for God: Whereas God would have this <hi>fleſh</hi> to be <hi>cheriſhed,</hi> (and no wiſe man ever did it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe<note n="z" place="margin">Eph. 5.29.</note> that in the wayes of God it may be uſed as a free and well-mann'd horſe, and not as a ſtarved and tired jade. So that this hypocrite pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this plauſible error, and oppoſeth Gods ſervant, his body, in ſtead of Gods enemy, the <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed that creature, the body, is weak unto good, and worthily deſerveth to be <hi>kept under in ſubjection</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27</note>, becauſe it is naturally ſtrong unto evil; and if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pampered, it will be as a fed horſe neighing after any wickedneſſe; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>Eſt modus, &amp;c.</hi> there is a meaſure and mean to be obſerved: and ſeeing God that hath inflicted this puniſhment of weakneſſe on the body, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bear with it, this hypocrite hath no ground to account it a vertue to deal ſo hardly with it</p>

                     <p>Yea, ſometimes this hypocrite miſtakes that for <hi>fleſh,</hi> which is rather <hi>ſpirit</hi> then fleſh; and fights againſt God in ſtead of warring againſt his enemy. Thus he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth true zeal in Gods ſervants, as frantick madneſſe<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 29.26</note>: He quarrels with truth as if it were errour<note n="c" place="margin">1 King. 22.24</note>, yea, <hi>blaſphemy</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He looks upon the <hi>fleſh</hi> as his ſoreſt enemie; but by <hi>fleſh</hi> he meanes not the fleſhy part of his outward man, his natural body, but the corruption that is in the whole man, as deadly poiſon diffuſed throughout the whole ſoul and body; which corruption is called <hi>fleſh,</hi> becauſe now propagated with the <hi>fleſh</hi> or body, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fleſh, and acted (partly, at leaſt) by the fleſhy members of the body, (as well as by the faculties of the ſoul) as <hi>inſtruments,</hi> and, as it were, <hi>weapons</hi> of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 6.13</note>; ſo native corruption is called fleſh, as on the contrary, Satan is called <hi>a ſpiritual wickedneſſe,</hi> becauſe none of theſe things agree to him, in his own act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Chriſtian therefore counteth that fleſh his enemy, not which he findeth to be the ſubſtance of his armes and legs, but which he perceiveth to deprave and corrupt both theſe and the reſt of the members of his ſubſtantial body, as well as the faculties of his ſoul<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 7.23</note>.</p>
                     <p>He wiſely diſtinguiſheth between that weak friend and his mighty enemy: yet, as in caſe of dangerous ſickneſſe, men are willing to open a veine, and ſpare ſome good blood, ſo in the ſpecial practice of mortification, the Chriſtian is content to keep down his very body by faſting, watching, and ſuch like acts of a true penitent; and to lighten the ſpiritual part, by taking down this ſaucy companion, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to teſtifie the true humiliation of his heart<note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like <hi>Michal,</hi> that lets the fleſh to eſcape, as ſhe did <hi>David,</hi> and put an image in the room thereof<note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 19.12, 13.</note>: the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Samuel,</hi> that will hew in pieces the chiefeſt <hi>Amalekite</hi>

Some are ſo coſtly that they require more then they yield, or then the ſinner is able longer to undergo. Some are ſo croſſe to the Profeſſion of Religion, as they force a very hypocrite, guilty of them, to hang down the head: and theſe, our hypocrite will fight with all, not as not loving them as ſinnes, but as being ſo diametrally oppoſite to all his intereſts and relations, that he is forced to thruſt them out of doors, as men in a ſtorme throw their goods over-board, to ſave his ſtake, and maintain his intereſt in the world.</p>
                     <p>If he ſee an Angel with a drawn ſword in the way, when he is going to earne the wages of iniquity, he will be content rather to caſhier that <hi>covetous practice,</hi> then

He will perhaps ſhew ſome ſharpneſſe againſt adultery, perjury, ſwearing, curſing, lying, ſtealing, &amp;c. If none of theſe be the ſpecial luſts to which he is moſt prone, or that he cannot commit them but all muſt take notice of it. But as for ſecret luſts, that the world cannot behold, or any ſins that he can commit in ſecret, here he is kind enough, and as good a friend to them, as they can finde elſewhere. He never draws ſword againſt any ſin, but that which all that know him do, or will cry ſhame upon him for. Shame is a ſtrong paſſion, and cauſeth him to fight many an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing duel with ſome fouler ſins, until that be verified of him, that <hi>he knoweth no ſhame</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Zeph. 3.5.</note>.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian fighteth against all ſin, as ſin.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He draws the <hi>ſword of the Spirit</hi> againſt every known ſin, although allowed of, or at leaſt tolerated by the world; yea, and againſt every ſecret ſin and corruption that he can diſcover, which is not diſcerned of the world; and fearing he ſhould not go far enough herein, he prayeth earneſtly to his God, <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 19.12</note>. He abhorreth ſinne as ſinne, and therefore muſt needs bid battel to every ſinne, and moſt to thoſe that lie cloſe and hid, leſt they blow him up ere he be aware.</p>
                     <p>He humbly thanketh God and his grace, that he is in no great trouble of ſpirit in fighting with crying and outragious wickedneſſes that are rife in others: yet he findes work enough to diſcover thoſe that lie in ambuſh for him, and to be free from thoſe that are of leſſe offence, as knowing them to be of no leſſe danger then other ſins, if he ſhould give way unto them.

                     <p>He may put on his armour, appear in the field, and make as if he did fight; but he lets flie far enough off from his ſpecial and beloved ſins, or he will ſtrike with the flat ſide of his ſword, not with the edge. <hi>Abſalom</hi> muſt have <hi>no harme.</hi> He holds intelligence with his darling ſin that is on the other ſide, and he will be ſure to take care of his ſafety, whoever elſe be cut off.

Whatever be the <hi>dearly beloved of his ſoul,</hi> whether honour, wealth, pleaſure, he muſt needs ſpare that, as <hi>Sauls army did the beſt of the ſheep,</hi> and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt booty. He can deny himſelf in outward things, fight againſt many noiſom luſts, but he will never forſake his opinions. He will abſtain from food, yet ſurfeit on erroneous poſitions. He can faſt, as <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Faſter,</hi> until he even pine himſelf, but yet at the ſame time be full cramb'd with pride and ambition, affecting ſo much the Title of Univerſal Biſhop, that he at length taught thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> to uſurp it. Or he can hold pace with <hi>Arminius,</hi> who by much faſting and prayer, as he would make the world beleeve, attained to his Pelagian diſtinctions and ſpeculations. And he (as all hereticks) can deny himſelf in any thing, even unto the death, ſave only in the baſtard brats of his brain, for which he will ſooner lay down his life, then fight one blow againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the Chriſtian hath one ſin againſt which he ſpecially fighteth,</hi>

                     <p>He favoureth none, but he will lay on moſt upon his minion or darling ſin, which without grace, yea, notwithſtanding grace, hath moſt power with him, he will never give a charge, as that doting father, <hi>Deal gently for my ſake with the young man</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 18.5</note>: but rather ſaith, as <hi>Joab</hi> to him that minded him of that charge given by

Nay, in compariſon, he ſeemeth to neglect other ſins, then ſuffer the Arch-rebel to live.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, as in a battel, many muſt be ſlain to make way to the General, many muſt fall on both ſides, before he can be touched. But he is reſolved with the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> to <hi>fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave only with the King.</hi> He will break through all the enemies Army to diſpatch him<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 22.31</note>. For he knows that if the General be once ſlain, the whole Army is diſcomfited. But becauſe the cutting off the chief Commander, putteth the victory out of queſtion, therefore the Chriſtian will hazard all, as <hi>David</hi> did, to kill <hi>Goliah;</hi> and, with his death to make an end for the preſent, of the battel.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Saul,</hi> ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> the chief ſin; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Samuel,</hi> that (after <hi>Saul</hi> had given unwarrantable quarter) <hi>hewed Agag to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>delicate coming</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> to move compaſſion<note n="b" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.33</note>; the one will not draw blood where there is moſt cauſe to deſtroy without mercy, the other thinks he hath drawn no blood at all, ſo long as the arch enemy is yet alive: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting all mercy to him to be the greateſt ſeverity to himſelf.</p>

                     <p>As cowardly Captains and ſouldiers of fortune waſte the countreys where they come, but are loth to meet and determine the controverſie in a ſet battel, ſo is it with this hypocrite. He is loth to come near: and when he is near, he hath ſtill ſomewhat to put him further off from the encounter. One faculty leadeth him one way; another, another way. Will and Affections are wholly for ſin, only Underſtanding and Conſcience keep a clamour againſt it. He never is reſolved to come upon ſin indeed, but he hath ſomewhat or other in him that gives ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his coming, that ſin may ſhift out of the way before he come to the place, and ſo prevent a fight. In him nothing but nature maintains the warre: therefore there is nothing but jugling between the adverſe parties, ſo as they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet, and when they do, there are on each ſide Counſellours, that counſel <hi>in utrámque partem,</hi> ſometimes for one ſide, ſometimes for the other, both aiming at this, not to engage in fight, if they can prevent it.</p>
                     <p>The underſtanding diſcovers ſin, Conſcience paſſeth ſentence, and gives warrant for execution. The Will and Affections are for a Reprive, if not for a pardon. So the man th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

However, the Will and Affections have ſcope enough, though the act be hindred; and he is like the dog that is held by the collar in ſight of the Beare at a diſtance; he ſtrives, and in a manner dieth, to get looſe, when yet he is not one foot nearer to the enemie.</p>

Every faculty is a field, or rather a liſt, wherein theſe two Champions, the Chriſtian and ſin, do meet and encounter. In his Underſtanding, light againſt darkneſſe, truth againſt errour; in his Will, obedience againſt rebellion; in his Conſcience, remorſe againſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; in his Affections, holineſſe againſt impurity. He knoweth, and yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not; he willeth, and would not; he deſireth, and affecteth not.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63232:195"/> Corruption being met with in a cloſe liſt, cannot ſtart aſide, but muſt needs ſtand to it, and take the foile.</p>

For whereas by corruption he would do wholly and meerly evil, grace hindreth the effect of that natural will: and where by grace he would do abſolutely well, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hindreth the effect of that ſanctified will.

                     <p>His main batteries and forces are bent againſt the inferiour faculties of the ſoul, ſenſuality, concupiſcence and the ſenſes; if he can ſubdue any of theſe to the will of ſin within him, he thinks he hath gotten a great Conqueſt. If he can delude the eye, or make uſe of the eye to entice the heart, and to provoke luſt: if he can but tickle any of the ſenſes and draw them over to the party of ſin, he glorieth in the victory. As for Reaſon, and the Will renewed, thoſe ſorts he looks upon as too ſtrong for him, and will make you beleeve, (as the Papiſts do) that no enemy is there.

As there can be no harmony of errours among themſelves, ſo neither of fleſhly luſts: what one luſt would have, will not conſiſt with the deſires of another; this oft-times breaks out into a Civil warre, or rather uncivil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of ſeveral luſts of the fleſh between themſelves. This is alwayes the caſe of this hypocrite: when he would gratifie one luſt, another luſt ſtands up and draws his ſword againſt the former, and againſt the hypocrite too, that harbours both. 'Tis here as in an Ale houſe or Brothel-houſe, he that will entertain all commers; (as he muſt, that keeps ſuch houſes) ſhall be leaſt Maſter in his own houſe, but be at the command and humour of his gueſts.</p>

He would pleaſe his appetite but for coſt, <hi>non tanti emet.</hi> He will not buy at ſuch a rate, as one luſt ſets upon the commodity that he cheapens to pleaſe another. He would be gripple and niggardly, but for pride, or his belly. He would be as free as any man, but for the love of money; He would be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but for cowardiſe.

                        <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 5.15</note>.

                        <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 8.13</note> of Chriſt, and by the fruits thereof within him.</p>
                     <p>Upon this account, he wageth warre with every enemy, not hiring one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy another, which he knows will end in the deſtruction of himſelf: he fights againſt ſin as ſin, therefore againſt every luſt as well as againſt any. Grace will be faithful to ſcoure the coaſts of all enemies, but the fleſh is deceitful and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and will certainly tyrannize over him that entertains it upon any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever, although it ſerve his turn at the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Ahaz,</hi> employing the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> drew upon himſelf not only the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> but <hi>Egypt</hi> too<note n="q" place="margin">Iſa. 7.17, 18.</note>, his luſts being againſt him as <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> (who though at variance between themſelves, yet) <hi>both ſet againſt Judah</hi>

                     <p>He will now and then put on the <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> againſt ſome over-grown luſt that he would fain be rid of, and cannot.

                     <p>Theſe are ſome peeces of Gods Armour, that being placed on a true Chriſtian, would be of excellent uſe in the ſpiritual warfare; but to the hypocrite they do no more good then weapons in the hand, either of a dead man that cannot defend himſelf with them, or of a mad man that will do miſchief by them.

And when he muſt fight, he is more a friend to the Traitour or Rebel againſt whom he fighteth, then to the Prince for whom he beares armes. At leaſt, his heart hangs that way. For though he ſay, <hi>non licet,</hi> it is not lawful to favour the enemy; yet with <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> he wiſheth, <hi>uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam liceret,</hi> it were lawful.

He is therefore a friend to corruption againſt the Law, even when he urgeth the Law againſt corruption. For Law doth not prevaile with him to hate corruption, but rather corruption makes

As ſome proſecute Law againſt malefactors, in appearance, yet favour them under hand; ſo he, while he uttereth, or ſeemeth to execute the ſentence of the Law againſt ſin, yet in heart he taketh part with ſin againſt the Law.

This hypocrite doth play, or act a combate, <hi>tanquam qui vincere non vult,</hi> as if he never meant to get the day, or win the field. He repenteth of ſin, when he findes and feels what it hath brought upon him; but he repents not from ſin and dead works to turn to the living God, as one that hates ſin.

                        <hi>This hypocrite hath not a victory, but only a ſhew of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is a true <hi>miles glorioſus,</hi> he brags of more victories then ever he ſaw battels; but as his victory is without fight, ſo his triumph is without victory. He that only muſters inſtead of fighting, will brag inſtead of overcoming. Hence he preſumeth and boaſteth that he hath <hi>eſcaped the corruptions that are in the world through luſt</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4</note>, when he hath only more cunningly covered them from the view of others, as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſate upon her fathers idols, under a pretence of modeſty<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 31.34, 35</note>, to hinder his diſcovery of them. If he have put on a demure countenance, a plain habit, a ſubmiſſe accent, theſe are his <hi>Inſignia victoriae,</hi> the badges of his Conqueſt. But as ſome had <hi>Conſular,</hi> others <hi>Queſtorian</hi> Enſignes in <hi>Rome,</hi> that never were <hi>Conſuls</hi> nor <hi>Queſtors,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus;</hi> ſo, many an hypocrite triumpheth as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, that never bore the brunt of a battel againſt ſin.</p>
                     <p>Satan laughs to ſee ſuch mock-Trophees ſet up, as wiſe men did at thoſe of the Jeſuites, when by publick Edict they were baniſhed <hi>France,</hi> they erected a pillar in token of their baniſhment, yet nevertheleſſe they had ſtill private acceſſe to the boſome of the King; ſo doth Satan erect pillars to proclaim his baniſhment from this hypocrites territories, when yet he hath free liberty to ſet up a new throne in his heart, and in ſecret to ſit on it ſo often as he pleaſeth. Hence this hypocrite is in no better caſe then the <hi>Trojans,</hi> by admitting the horſe which the <hi>Grecians</hi> feigned to leave behinde them as a teſtimony of their flight, in the bowels of which horſe lay the death of the <hi>Trojans.</hi> He ſuppoſing a victory when there is none, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a meanes to convey advantages to the enemy, whereby he that doth it may be more ſurely and ſpeedily cut off. He that boaſteth of conquering Satan, while yet he hath a throne in that mans heart, doth but give Satan a fairer opportunity to enſlave him for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the Christian hath a true victory, as appears by his deſire of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conqueſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is ſtill, either overcoming or purſuing his Conqueſt, never idle, never at that pitch, that he thinks he hath done enough. He is either ſorrowing for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or in deſire and fervent expectation of grace to be revived; or under Vow and Covenant of obedience to be performed, never without ſome action or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for further rooting out thoſe Canaanites and Philiſtines, that yet remain in his ſoul uncrucified. He never cries victory ſo long as one enemie remaineth unſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like the bragging Spaniard in eighty eight, that cried Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, Victory, on land, while their fellows were ſinking in the ſea: the true Chriſtian gives notice of his victory, as <hi>Cuſhi</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>the Lord had aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him of all thoſe that roſe up againſt him</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 18.31</note>: the one boaſteth before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as <hi>Goliah of giving Davids fleſh to the fowles of the aire, and to the beaſts of the field</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrites victory is not total.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where he makes greateſt ſhew of victory, it is at moſt but a peece of a victory. He overcometh ſome vices, but not all. If he break and rout the Van, he leaves the Rere untouched. If he cut off the wings, yet he ſets not upon the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> or main battel; his ſpecial ſin that remains whole and entire, and keeps its ground. <hi>Horod</hi> did many things, and left (no doubt) ſome of his ſins, at the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63232:199"/> but not his inceſt: nay, he after beheaded him that would have cut off that head and Maſter-ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> (in all likelihood) amended ſome things, cut off ſome enemies to his ſoul (elſe he had not been fit to have been at all of Chriſts retinue;) but not his covetouſneſſe and falſe heart; he was ſtill a <hi>thief,</hi> ſtill a <hi>devil.</hi> Still the <hi>fat ſheep bleateth,</hi> and the <hi>fat oxe loweth,</hi> after all <hi>Sauls</hi> execution<note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.14</note>; the ſpecial ſin ſtill liveth, and (as <hi>Agag</hi>) not fearing death, yet reigneth. Or, in overcoming one ſin he is overcome by another; as young gallants having ſpent their bodies and goods in the devils ſervice, in a way of leudneſſe and luxury, become weary of that, and ſerve him in another kinde, turning Papiſts and Traitors; or, of waſtful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals, become covetous Mammoniſts, and ſo he doth not ſo much overcome ſin, as exchange it, and commute with God or any other that will traffick with him for ſuch helliſh wares.</p>
                     <p>And even in thoſe very ſins wherein he ſeems to be a Victor, he is not changed in himſelf, nor are thoſe very ſins dead, but only caſt into a ſwoon. <hi>Pilum, non men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem;</hi> he may have changed his haire and hue, but not his minde; he may hamper and halter ſin, but he puts it not to death. The wolfe is a wolfe ſtill; 'tis as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to truſt him now, as heretofore. The horſe is an horſe ſtill, although he have a bridle in his mouth<note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 32.9</note>, yet beware of his heels<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 32.15</note>. Such is this hypocrite, in whom ſin is repreſſed, but not ſuppreſſed, not totally vanquiſhed, at leaſt not hewen in peeces. Such Jades will one time or other break bridle, or run away with it in their teeth: for, in violent tentations, and in luſts grown ſtrong by reſt, neither na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor reaſon, nor common grace is ſufficient. <hi>Haman</hi> for a while refrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thought to let <hi>Mordecai</hi> alone to periſh with the reſt of his people whom he had deſtinated to deſtruction, for his malice to <hi>Mordecai;</hi> but at length his rage and paſſion grew into ſuch a flame, as put him out of his fence, and cauſed him to run furiouſly upon his own deſtruction, by haſtning revenge upon <hi>Mordecai,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fatal day could come upon the reſt devoted to ſlaughter with him.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtians care is to ſubdue all ſin.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereſoever he findes an enemy, be it but a Scout or a Spie, he fights him, he makes not ſo much as a truce with any, much leſſe a compoſition to let the enemie go away with bag and baggage, with colours flying, and bullet in the mouth. He takes all that he can light on, gives quarter to none that he taketh in battel. And ſo careful is he to rid the field of all, that he ſtands armed in the field, after he hath beaten and vanquiſhed all that appeared, and prepares for ſuch as are yet undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>David,</hi> that not only endeavoured to ſubdue all his known ſins, and to be <hi>kept from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> but prayed alſo to be <hi>cleanſed from his ſecret faults</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 19 12</note>; not which he cheriſhed knowingly (for of this ſort he had none<note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 119.104 Pſ. 139.23, 24</note>) but which he had not yet diſcovered in himſelf, or not <hi>understood</hi> to be <hi>errors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He repenteth (at leaſt in the general) of unknown ſins, as well as of ſins known. And although the victory be in this life, in ſome ſenſe imperfect, for that all the rebellions, mutinies and lurkings of ſin be not abſolutely taken away; yet he is ſure to provide ſufficiently againſt the reign and quiet poſſeſſion of any ſpiritual enemie whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The power of grace chargeth through, and through the whole body of ſin, and <hi>casteth down,</hi> not only the actings but the very <hi>imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf against the knowledge of God, and bringeth into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5</note>. He leaveth no member unmortified, no ſin unſubdued, even when the reliques and remaines of ſin be not wholly grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth he loſe ground in one place, while he gaines in another. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying vertue which he draws from the death of Chriſt, hath its influence upon <hi>the whole old man</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 6.6</note> within him, although perhaps he employ it more eſpecially againſt ſome particular members of the body of ſin. As when Chriſt curſed <hi>the fig-tree</hi> in more ſpecial reference to the branches that bare no fruit, the whole tree immediately <hi>withered</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 21.19, 20</note>. All ſin in him is not only tamed and brought under, that it cannot domineer, rage and rant, as formerly it did, but hath received its
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63232:200"/> mortal wound whereby it languiſheth and conſumeth away more and more, <hi>nullis medicabilis herbis,</hi> as being paſt all recovery, and haſtning to not only a diſſolution, but to a total annihilation.</p>
                     <p>He is not only changed in his converſation, but in his inclination alſo, becauſe <hi>partaker of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4</note>. He is not as <hi>Eſau,</hi> that for a time diſſembleth hatred, with intent of further miſchief at a fitter ſeaſon<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 27 41</note>, (which is to ſtop ſin, not to deſtroy it; to delay the execution, not to cut off the power of corruption:) but he is become like <hi>Jonathan,</hi> content that <hi>David</hi> ſhould be King, and himſelf a ſubject, that Chriſt ſhould reign to the deſtroying of all within him that ſhould oppoſe Chriſt, although it be to the <hi>cutting off of his right hand, or to the plucking out of his right eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Saul,</hi> who pretending to have obeyed the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord in deſtroying the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the prey, and therefore was rejected; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Samuel,</hi> who hewed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag</hi> in peeces, that the voice of the Lord might indeed be obeyed, and was accepted. The one is as <hi>Ahab,</hi> letting <hi>go a man,</hi> to wit, <hi>Benhadad, appointed to deſtruction</hi>

                     <p>If he overcome, yet as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he cannot <hi>uti victorià,</hi> manage the day to the beſt advantage. He may worſt his adverſary, and be Maſter of the field at preſent: but he purſues not the victory ſo as to prevent the rallying of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, or ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſing of new forces to fight another battel. If the devil be driven out of the eyes, out of the mouth, or out of any part of the outward man, yet if ſtill he be ſuffered to keep the Caſtle of an unſanctified heart, he is all this while no great loſer, nor this hypocrite a gainer, even when he wins the field; becauſe he doth not purſue the enemy, <hi>etiam in castra,</hi> even to his Camp and City, and ſubdue both, before he be able to make head again.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite may ſo far prevail, as to abate the impetuouſneſſe of ſome ſinful luſts for a ſeaſon, as <hi>Davids</hi> muſick for a time wrought on <hi>Saul</hi> to allay his fury and phrenſie, but not to cure it. So is it with the hypocrite in the caſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo, as with <hi>Balaam,</hi> while death was before him, he forbare to curſe the people of God; but being at more liberty, when he ſaw he could not bring Gods curſe upon them, he and the devil joyned counſels to put them into a way to bring it upon themſelves, by yielding <hi>to eat things ſacrificed to idols</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Rev. 2.14</note>, that thereby they might ſatisfie their luſts upon the <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> women, who (by the counſel of <hi>Balaam</hi>) went out to tempt the Iſraelites all they could, and then, when their luſts were in a flame, put the Iſraelites upon the ſacrificing to idols, before they would proſtitute their bodies to them.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Joaſh</hi> ſmote <hi>thrice upon the ground with the arrows</hi> which he had in his hand, and then ſtayed, whereas he <hi>ſhould have ſmitten five or ſix times,</hi> and then had he <hi>ſmitten Syria till he had conſumed it, when now he ſhould ſmite it but thrice</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">2 Kings 13 18.19</note>. So this hypocrite repelleth ſin once, twice, perhaps thrice, but no more; and every time more faintly then other, but for want of conſtant purſuit, is never able to make a compleat Conqueſt. Yea, even in repelling he is inured to tentation, and every time taketh a little taſte of the ſweetneſſe of ſin, till at laſt he yieldeth, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly overcome; as ſome moral Papiſts at firſt ſtartle at any motion to engage in Treaſon, but at every freſh aſſault become more yielding, till at length they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſperate Traitors.</p>
                     <p>Conſcience is a plain dealer, but concupiſcence is crafty. Hence it is, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is often overtaken and abuſed. The often hearing of evil, the wiſhing it lawful, the vain diſtinctions made by ſome men, whoſe wit is too good for their conſcience; do at length ſilence and benumb conſcience, that it cannot longer hold
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63232:200"/> out againſt the tentation. Even upon victory men are apt to grow ſo ſecure, as to loſe more by their ſecurity, than they won by their victory. To neglect a beaten adverſary as weak, is dangerous: for it gives great advantage to the enemy, or to any that will take up weapons for his reſcue, as we ſee in the caſe of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites,</hi> who having ſacked, <hi>ſmitten and burnt Ziklag,</hi> fell afterwards <hi>to eating, drinking and dancing, becauſe of the great ſpoile they had taken. David</hi> came among them, and <hi>ſmote them from the twilight, even unto the evening of the next day, and recovered all that the Amalekites had taken away</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">1 Sam. 30.16 17, 18</note>; ſo is it in the moſt ſpiritual conflict of this hypocrite, in whoſe Camp, in ſtead of keeping a ſtrong guard, and perpetual ſending out of Scouts, there is nothing but <hi>eating, and drinking, and riſing up to play</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 32.6</note>, after a victory.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the Chriſtian ſtill purſueth,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is as <hi>Marcellus,</hi> of whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> made this obſervation, that he was always conquered, or conquering; if conquered, ſtriving to recover his loſſes; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, ſtill purſuing the victory. If he be foiled, he riſeth up afreſh, and every time more mighty, and more puiſſant; becauſe thereby made more humble, more lothing himſelf, more out of love with the world, more acquainted with Satans wiles and depths, and every way more pliable to Gods diſpenſations. If he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, he doth not change the ſound of the Drum and Trumpet into the noiſe of the pipe, nor fighting into daliance. But rather reſolves <hi>Canitiem in galea premere,</hi> to thruſt hoary haires into his helmet, as if he had none ſuch. He is <hi>Veteranus,</hi> an old beaten ſouldier, but not <hi>emeritus,</hi> one that ſues to be diſcharged from further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the warres, from which he knowes <hi>there is no diſcharge</hi> on earth<note n="y" place="margin">Eccl. 8.8</note>.</p>
                     <p>He is no leſſe careful to maintain the victory than to get it. He knoweth that as ſickneſſe, ſo ſin is moſt dangerous in the relapſe. He conſidereth that ſin is as the ſea, that if it be ſhut out, will ſhove hard to get in again. Therefore as the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> are careful to obſerve tides, and to maintain their banks; ſo is it with the Chriſtian: his care makes him fearful, and his feare diligent to prevent deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which without conſtant care and diligence cannot be prevented. Indeed, if every thing had its due, the ſea ſhould cover <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſo as that ſhould be all <hi>ſea,</hi> and no <hi>land:</hi> ſo would it be with our nature, unleſſe <hi>the prey were taken from the mighty, and the lawful captive delivered</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Iſa. 49.24</note>.</p>
                     <p>Our nature is a very <hi>Sea land,</hi> or rather <hi>Sin-land,</hi> won from the Ocean of ſin, which would overflow all, as it was wont to do, but that God by his grace firſt made the dry land to appear, and ever after, ſet barres and bounds to the ſea of ſin, to ſtay the proud waves thereof. For he that giveth victory to the Chriſtian, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter victory addeth wiſdom, to make him more watchful, and to continue to uſe the meanes with more care, and hope of ſucceſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite after all his victories is like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſleeping in <hi>Delilah</hi>'s lap while ſhe cuts off his locks, and expoſeth him to the power and rage of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Job,</hi> who <hi>all the days of his appointed time will wait and watch till his change come</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Job 14, 14</note>; the one by ſecurity is made a ſlave after Conqueſt, the other by vigilancy becomes a perpetual Conquerour, no more ſubject to his former ſlavery.</p>

                     <p>Thus this hypocrite is like <hi>Saul,</hi> who when <hi>Samuel</hi> reproved him for ſparing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag</hi> and the beſt of the ſpoil, put that off as the act of <hi>the people</hi>

If he admit of any ſorrow for ſin, it is but ſuch as a ſmall matter will cure: He will be ſure not to ſorrow to death, nor as others that have no hope. He can eaſily put a period to his grief for ſin by any falſe comfort, by whomſoever applied; and is willing to hear of any extenuation of his fact, as <hi>Alexander,</hi>

                     <p>Indeed if he ſet up a revenge of his own, or mans invention, which may cauſe him rather to be admired by the Spectators, than to be truly humbled in a way of Gods appointment, there he will lay on and not ſpare, beyond all reaſon or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, <hi>who cut themſelves with knives and lancers, till the blood guſhed out upon them</hi>

But he never growes wiſer, ſo as to forſake all ſin, and to lay hold on mercy. Poſſibly he may commit that one ſin no more, either through want of opportunity, or as finding it too dear, but he never forſakes all ſin, nor indeed any ſin for the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, or as taking hold of Chriſt by faith for pardon, with reſolution upon Gods <hi>ſpeaking peace,</hi> to <hi>returne no more to folly</hi>

                        <hi>filled with wrath, roſe up, thruſt him out of the City, and led him to the brow of the Hill (whereon their City was built) that they might caſt him down headlong; he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the midſt of them, went his way</hi>

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 13.31 32, 33</note>.

And in this he was no doubt the more confirmed afterwards, when having betrayed him, and the ſouldiers and officers coming to apprehend him, ſo ſoon as Chriſt <hi>went forth unto them,</hi> and told them, <hi>I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground</hi>

                     <p>In like manner, <hi>Cain</hi> took on when he heard the curſe pronounced, and ſentence paſſed: he might be ſaid to repent as <hi>Judas</hi> did, upon the apprehenſion of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and wrath; not growing ſo wiſe, as to ſue for mercy and pardon, but ſo mad and deſperate as to flie <hi>from the face of God,</hi> that is, from the very Ordinances of God, wherein God meeteth his people to <hi>bleſſe them, in turning them away from their iniquities</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 3.26</note>: He grieved enough out of fear; but, deſpairing of favour, ſought not for grace, but only a tolerable degree of enmity; a reprival for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he might fall to building, and forget his miſery. Thus this hypocrite ſeeks to end his grief in deſpaire, and his repentance in hell, having no hope to be reconciled unto God.

                     <p>Again, in the beginnings of Converſion there are certain ſeeds of faith and hope in the elect, which are hardly diſcerned even by themſelves: only they appear in this, that the poor ſinner, how grievouſly ſoever he hath ſinned, and how ſharply ſoever God threatneth or puniſheth him, yet he clingeth about God in Chriſt, as the childe to his father even when he is angry, and lieth proſtrate at his feet, and will not depart from him, let God deal with him as he pleaſeth. And this is a perpetual act and fruit of fairh. Therefore he will take Gods part againſt himſelf, even before he be ſure of pardon, as the poor woman that wept upon the feet of our Saviour, before ſhe had any encouragement from him<note n="u" place="margin">Luke 7.38</note>. The Penitent often weepeth before pardon; but after, much more, that ſo good a God ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly uſed.

So is it with this hypocrite, ſin never troubles him, till he feel the ſmart of it; then, it may be, for the puniſhments ſake he cries out of his folly alſo. But to look upon ſin, as ſin, as a breach of Gods Law, as a diſhonour to God, as being abhorrent to his nature, this he never troubles himſelf withal.

                     <p>He that endeavours in all things to pleaſe God, cannot but be grieved, when God is grieved, and glad when his grief is prevented, eſpecially in himſelf. He therefore commendeth the wiſe Providence of God, and deſires to be for ever thankful for that great mercy, whereby he is ſtopped or croſſed in any ſinful courſe, as <hi>David</hi> did, when by the wiſe and diſcreet carriage of <hi>Abigail, he was kept from ſhedding blood, and from avenging himſelf with his own hand</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.32, 33.</note>, according to what in a paſſion he had raſhly determined and vowed<note n="t" place="margin">Ver. 22</note>. Whatever he may think and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do in a rage, or when under a tentation, yet if God ſtep in, and turn him back from his purpoſe, or croſſe him in it, he would not for a world that he had not met with ſuch a croſſe and diſappointment. He had rather to have been cut off for his firſt offence, than to go on to commit more. His heart ſmiteth him, when he findeth himſelf to proſper in any evil way, as fearing that his making work for repentance, will be ſadly reſented by his God, and coſt him dearer than all his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe will be able to recompence.</p>
                     <p>Fooles indeed are never better pleaſed than when they proſper in the worſt ways, nor more vexed than when they meet with a rub therein. <hi>Seculi laetitiae est impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita iniquitas,</hi> impunity in wickedneſſe is the joy of wicked men, ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> but, <hi>magnae miſericordiae eſt, nequitiae impunitatem non relinquere,</hi> it is great mercy in God not to leave his children, when they ſin, without correction.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites repentance is a Turkiſh repentance, which never lamenteth any thing as evil, but that which hath evil ſucceſſe; the true Chriſtian is more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſucceſſe in evil, than the hypocrite can be for want thereof. The one is as <hi>Balaam,</hi> more angry with his Aſſe that would ſave his life, by not carrying him on in his way to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than he was with himſelf for attempting that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe; the other is better pleaſed with him that will ſtop him in his courſe of ſin, than with him that would furniſh him with ſwitch and ſpurres in that road towards hell.</p>

                     <p>It is not hatred of ſin but his impotency to purſue it as heretofore, that makes him give it over, as ſomtimes lame <hi>Loyola</hi> the <hi>Biſcain,</hi> maimed in both his thighes by the <hi>French</hi> at the ſiege of the Caſtle of <hi>Pamplona</hi> in <hi>Navarre,</hi> while yet a young man, gave over the wars, and entring into a monaſtical life, became the father of thoſe Locuſts of the bottomleſſe pit, the Jeſuites, thoſe arch Incendiaries of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and of all the world where they can get footing. Many ſuch lame ſouldiers of ſin there are, whoſe hearts are as eager upon ſin, as ever <hi>Ignatius,</hi> upon cruelty, after he had left the field; but when they look upon their limmes, are with grief of heart for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cry out with <hi>Milo, At hi quidem jam mortui ſunt;</hi> verily theſe limmes are dead, as to any vivacious action. Faine they would go on in ſin as greedily as ever: but cannot; ſtrength and nature now faile, which is no ſmall trouble of heart unto them.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite leaves ſin, as he leaves the world, to wit, when the world leaves him. Some ſins forſake their ſervants, as ſcorning any longer to be ſerved by thoſe that are grown ſo old and feeble; ſuch ſervants being grieved at nothing ſo much as to be turned out of ſervice, having as much good-will to the ſame drudgery as ever.

So doth this hypocrite ſeem ſometimes to do great things, not out of readineſſe to duty, but of neceſſity of not doing otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he forbears ſin for want of opportunity, as drunkards when they be at ſea, forbear drunkenneſſe for want of Tavernes, Alehouſes, or other opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. If he do any good, it is becauſe he cannot help it; as ſome give to the poor at their deaths, when they can no longer hold what they have.

It is his grief that ſin hath had ſo much of his youth and prime. He had rather die, or be unborne, then ſo to be young again, as to follow thoſe luſts anew which formerly he gave the reines unto. And if he finde his former luſts to haunt him ſtill, and to pull him by the ſleeve, as deſiring the ſame entertainment he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gave them, he is glad at heart that he is able to ſay he is unable to gratifie them as heretofore; and he had rather be as feeble as <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>no covering with cloathes would get him heat,</hi> and when <hi>Abiſhag</hi> lay in his boſome, and <hi>he knew her not</hi>

Glad is the true repentant ſinner that he hath lived ſo long, as to ſee the ſins of his youth left ſo farre behind him; he rejoyceth more in the decay of nature, that may diſable him from ſin, than in any ſtrength of body to gratifie his luſts.

Or as <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the firſt Turkiſh Emperour, firſt glutted himſelf with the pleaſure of his <hi>Irene,</hi> and then, in a ſolemn preſence, cut off her head: or as male-contents bid the world adieu, or ſend a Paſquil of defiance to the Court, as having much more than enough of waiting there to no purpoſe? ſo, this hypocrite, having enough of his ſin in regard of ſome inconvenience or miſchief befallen him by it, he ſeems to be much affected for his giving way unto it, when all his grief is, not in relation to God as being thereby provoked, but in reference to himſelf that hath been too much a ſufferer by meanes thereof.</p>

                     <p>He hateth not this, or that particular ſin, becauſe of the miſchief it hath brought upon himſelf, but hates it ſimply as ſin whereby God is diſhonoured. Himſelf he hateth, his companions he pitieth. He ſeeth more circumſtances at leaſt, to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſin in himſelf, than in any other of his partners in it. He had had more admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to repent: God hath ſtood longer knocking at his door, and uſed more meanes by counſel, example, bleſſings, chaſtiſements, to reclaim him. He hath made more promiſes, vowes of better carriage. His profeſſion, place, rank and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63232:207"/> quality call for better things, and ſuffer much by his exorbitancy, ſo as he more then others hath <hi>crucified to himſelf the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame</hi>

                     <p>He findeth the gate of Gods mercy open to himſelf, therefore he laboureth to bring others along to enter with him; praying for them, exhorting of them, and ſo far as he may without danger of being corrupted, converſing with them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them.

                     <p>As ſelf-love is the ground of all he doth for God, ſo ſelf-harme is the object which he chiefly eyeth in his repenting. He compareth not ſin with Gods juſtice, but with his own ſafety, and then no marvel to ſee him ſorry, <hi>when he hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his fleſh and his body.</hi> As he is in love, not with the Goſpel as the minde of Chriſt, but with the outward peace and liberty which the Goſpel bringeth: nor with vertue, but with the credit and other companions with which it is attended; ſo on the other ſide, he is out of love, not with the evil which he hath ſowen, but with the affliction which he hath reaped, <hi>He ſetteth himſelf in a way that is not good, his heart doth not abhorre evil</hi>

                     <p>Iniquity without affliction were pleaſant, and he would never finde fault with it; If he could ſeparate the ſin from the ſhame, ſin could never incur his hatred, nor put him to grief. But when miſery is upon him, then he cries out and howleth, then he will perhaps pray, remove this <hi>plague,</hi> not this <hi>ſin.</hi> And it may be he will ſay, <hi>I have ſinned;</hi> but it is the verdict of conſcience that ſhames the devil; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his doom, but belieth his feeling. <hi>Qui Gehennam metuit, non metuit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, ſed ardere.</hi> He that parts with ſin for feare of hell, doth not feare to ſin, but to burne.</p>

                     <p>Indeed puniſhment helpeth and correcteth his taſte, as we ſee in the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> who finding the diſpleaſure of God to purſue them by an unuſual ſtormy raine, for the ſin of taking <hi>strange wives,</hi> ſate <hi>trembling becauſe of this matter, and for the great rain</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Ezra 10.9</note>. So the Iſraelites in the dayes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> were brought by the unſeaſonable weather, to taſte the bitterneſſe of their ſin with more quickneſs of palate<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.18, 19</note>. But this happens, when his people are made Gods taſters, not their own, and conceive of ſin according to Gods deteſtation. Thus was <hi>David</hi> affected and offended with his ſin, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 51.4</note>; not as if he, being a King, had not at all ſinned againſt <hi>

                     <p>It is God that teacheth him (by reforming his palate) how ſouce the fruits of ſin are to a ſpiritual taſte. He firſt findes ſin it ſelf to be of <hi>the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah,</hi> and then findes <hi>the grapes</hi> (or fruit thereof) to be <hi>grapes of gall, and the cluſters bitter</hi>

But he that thus doth, conſiders not ſo much what himſelf, as what Chriſt ſuffereth for his ſins, and mourneth more for Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings than for his owne.

                        <note n="k" place="margin">Zech. 12.10</note>. He ſeeth Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the bitterneſſe of his fathers wrath. He looketh on ſin with Gods eyes, and beholdeth it in thoſe wounds of Chriſts body, and torments of his ſoule, and ſo cannot but in reaſon deteſt it more then hell.<note place="margin">Aug.</note> 
                        <hi>Ille peccare metuit qui peccatum ſicut Gehennam metuit.</hi> He is afraid to ſin, who feareth ſin as he feares hell it ſelf; not ſo much for fear of hell to himſelf, as of that hell which he ſees Chriſt hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who underwent the torments <hi>damnandorum,</hi> of thoſe that deſerved damnation; but not <hi>damnatorum,</hi> of thoſe that were actually damned; for theſe ſuffer an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſeparation from God, with deſpair of better condition, which Chriſt never did ſo much as for a moment.</p>
                     <p>It is not the feare of a <hi>fiery furnace,</hi> that can force him upon the committing of ſin, as we ſee in <hi>the three children</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Dan. 3.15, &amp;c</note>. They feared ſin more than the furnace, how hot ſoever. Nor is it the ſhame of the world but the loathſomneſſe of ſin, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth him from the acting of it. For, if feare of worldly ſhame drive a man on upon ſin, to avoid ſhame; it will much more keep him from repentance, upon that very reaſon, and rather encite him to commit more ſin, than to repent of what is already committed, as we ſee daily in thoſe that adde murder to fornication, in hope to avoid the ſhame of an illegitimate conception.

                        <note n="m" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1.</note>. But, fame muſt give place to conſcience. If a man by malice, ſhall be defamed, if he yield not againſt conſcience to what deſerves defamation, the true Penitent will undergo all the defamations in the world, rather than prevent it by ſin, or by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for ſin as God requireth, what ſhame ſoever he ſuſtain from the world. <hi>Is virtutem verè estimat qui boni viri famam perdit, ne conſcientiam perdat.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> He right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly values vertue, that had rather loſe the repute and fame of being a good man, than by maintaining his fame, violate his conſcience, and become evil. <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> choſe rather to be reputed and ſcorned of all his Army, and even at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as a Coward, than hazard the loſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> by unſeaſonable giving battel to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to redeem that blot. So is it with a true Penitent, he will do his duty, ſhame him for it who will: he will commit no ſin to prevent ſhame, what ſhame ſoever he ſuffer thereby. By all which it appeareth, that when he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is neither feare, nor ſhame, nor ſmart, but only ſin as ſin which hath coſt his Saviour dearer than it can coſt himſelf, that he hath in his eye, and layeth moſt to heart.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like <hi>Lucretia,</hi> that ſtood more upon honour than upon innocency, and choſe rather to be defiled by <hi>Tarquinius,</hi>

                        <note n="x" place="margin">Jer. 4.1</note>. God that calleth from one ſin, calleth from all; nor liketh he one ſin better than another, who abhorreth all.

                     <p>Hence, when the Chriſtian prayeth to be turned from <hi>covetouſneſſe,</hi> he withal ſupoſicateth that his heart might be <hi>enclined unto Gods Teſtimonies</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119.36</note>; as well knowing that if he were not fixed upon them, his heart would pitch upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe as bad as the Mammon, from which he deſires to be turned. And, that it concerneth him as much to ſee whom he receiveth, as what he expelleth, that he may not put out one devil, and take in another in the room; that he may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Popery, and fall to Anabaptiſme, or turne aſide to the ſeparation: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all errours, and cleave to the truth of God; abhorre all ſin and wickedneſſe, and walk in the wayes of God.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as one that goeth to the devil, as to a poſt-maſter, for a freſh horſe, to carry him the reſt of his way to hell, when he leaps out of one ſin into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the true Chriſtian in turning from ſin is as one of thoſe Angels in <hi>Jacobs</hi> viſion, that immediately ſets his foot upon the <hi>ladder,</hi> to aſcend unto <hi>God, who ſtands at the top</hi>

                     <p>Either his repentance is only <hi>oral,</hi> conſiſting only in complementing of God, thinking to pleaſe him with a few good words, even while he retains a <hi>whores forehead, refuſing to be aſhamed</hi> for what he hath done.

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Jer. 3.3, 4, 5</note>. Or, it is <hi>Hyſtrionical,</hi> conſiſting in an affected Artificial, uttering of ſome words or ſentences drawn up before, or conceived at preſent; or in the reading, ſaying, or ſinging, in a mournful tone, certain penitential Pſalmes, or prayers penned upon other occaſions, and little ſuting with his; or, haply drawn up as a part in a Tragedy, framed out of wit, not out of grief of heart, and uttered out of memory, not depth of ſorrow, and perhaps in meeter alſo, in an apiſh imitation of <hi>David</hi> and other Saints of old, whoſe hearts being deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their ſins, breathed, yea, poured out thoſe mournful ditties, and pathetical petitions into the boſome of their God, and were accepted.

His hands and feet are reſtrained, but not his heart. He may forbear the exerciſe, but not the habit of ſin. A ſenſe ſo loſt, may be recovered. Such a privation denieth not a regreſſion. His going back from ſin is not a flight, but a retreat. He keepeth his rank ſtill, that he may come on again. He hath no reſolute purpoſe to forſake ſin, but only ſome faint unſetled deliberation.

                        <note n="o" place="margin">Joel 2.13</note>. What good, ſaith he, will a plaiſter do me in the face, when the ulcers is in my breaſt? He knows that it is not knocking his breaſt, but breaking of his heart to peeces by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, that makes a penitent, <hi>Qui pectus tundit, &amp; cor non corrigit, peccata ſolidat non tollit.</hi> He that beats his breaſt without afflicting his ſoul, confirmeth ſin and not removeth it. He that repenteth for forme, hardeneth his heart which ſhould be contrite. He layeth aſide Art and flouriſhes, and falls down-right upon the heart, with all his heart. His heart enditeth with ſorrow, what his tongue uttereth. Yea, ſometimes his heart poureth out ſo much ſorrow, that like water out of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bottle, it ſtops by the way, cauſing the tongue to be ſilent, and his eyes only to ſpeak by tears, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe tears we read of, but nothing of his words. <hi>Totus ſibi diſplicet,</hi> he is utterly out of love with ſin and himſelf. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſword of repentance to ſtrike through the heart of ſin, not only through the ſenſitive appetite, but through the reaſonable appetite alſo, to wit, the will. <hi>Quam profundè peccaverit, &amp;c.</hi> how deeply ſoever he hath revolted, ſo throughly he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth. He hateth both the meat, and the broth of ſin, the skin and the coat. Yea, he ſo fenceth himſelf againſt ſin, that he is ſafe from the love of ſin, even when he cannot be wholely free from acting of it. Do it he poſſibly may, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it he will never. Herein he differs from the hypocrite, as <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Balaam,</hi> the one had a minde to the evil which he could not do; the other being <hi>changed by the renewing of his mind</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12.2</note>, ſometimes doth the evil which his heart abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 7.15</note>.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Judah,</hi> that pretending repentance, <hi>turned not to the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63232:209"/> Lord with the whole heart,</hi> but <hi>feignedly</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 3.10</note>: the true penitent is as thoſe humbled <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> who <hi>ſorrowed after a godly ſort, that in all things they approved themſelves clear of that matter</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11</note>, of which they repented. The one is as <hi>Ephraim, a cake not turned</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Hoſ. 7.8</note>, but half bak't, he repenteth but by halves; the other turneth his cake, that it may be throughly baked on both ſides. The one mourneth for his ſin as thoſe <hi>cunning women</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Jer 9.17</note>, and other <hi>skilful in lamentation</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrite repenteth on the ſudden, and all at once.</hi>

                     <p>As a man not well awake riſeth up haſtily in a feare or fright; but afterwards lies down again when the fright is over. So this hypocrite being ſcared, ſuddenly beſtirs him during the fright; but after returnes to his old ſecurity, and repoſeth in his neſt of ſin with as much content as ever. If he be put into an amazing feare, he will then do any thing, as <hi>Tullus,</hi> that wicked King of the old Romanes, <hi>in re trepida duodecem vovit ſalios</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Liv. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note>, being put into a great trembling, he would needs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of <hi>Numa,</hi> (to whoſe manners he was moſt unlike) vow to dedicate twelve dancing Prieſts unto <hi>Mars:</hi> not out of devotion, but ſudden ſurpriſal with fear; but afterwards repenteth of being ſo haſty, or at leaſt ſuch repentance cometh to nothing; he ſoon forgets what he promiſed, and falls back again to his old courſe; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that in a fright lets <hi>Iſrael;</hi> go, but they were no ſooner gone, but he purſues them.</p>
                     <p>And what he doth in repentance, he diſpatcheth at once. He that on the ſudden is ſo forward and haſty, cannot long hold out. It is an unnatural (not ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural) motion, therefore he cannot retain his firſt ſpeed and ſwiftneſſe. His heart-ſtrings ſo ſuddenly ſtrained, cannot hold. He is as that Scribe that was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken with Chriſt, and told him confidently at the firſt, <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goest</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 8.19</note>, but when Chriſt told him he had not ſo much as the foxes, or birds, to bring him to, we hear of no one ſtep made by this Scribe, after ſo poor a Maſter. If Chriſt lie in the fields, let him lie there alone. At firſt, <hi>Orpah</hi> was as forward as <hi>Ruth,</hi> to go with <hi>Naomi</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Ruth 1.10</note>; but after her firſt offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe never made a ſecond, but kiſſed her mother and departed<note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 14</note>; ſo this hypocrite is as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at firſt, as any, to repent: but his firſt act is his laſt: if God will accept of his firſt offer and act, he may; he is never like to have more.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Penitent proceedeth upon adviſed reſolution,</hi>

                        <hi>and is daily adding to his repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſits down firſt, and ſeriouſly conſidereth what he hath been, and done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the Law and minde of God; what God requireth, and how he is to perform it, and thereupon maturely, and deliberately reſolveth to ſet upon the work, not in his own ſtrength, but in his <hi>that gives repentance unto Iſrael,</hi> walking on therein from ſtrength to ſtrength. The more he thinketh what he hath been, and what by grace he is, the more he endeavours to continue what he is, and to be kept from relapſing. Yea, he taketh more and more revenge on his fleſh and heart that ſet him at enmity with God, and condemneth himſelf, eſpecially for this, that he reſolved no ſooner to condemn and forſake his former <hi>wayes that are not good: and to loath himſelf in his own eyes for his iniquities and abominations</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 36.31</note>.</p>
                     <p>He is not ſo raſh, ſudden; confident as the hypocrite: he entreth upon this work with fear and baſhfulneſſe; is afraid to be over-much noted at the firſt. He firſt <hi>communeth with his own heart upon his bed, and is ſtill</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 4.4</note>, or ſilent, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a noiſe to draw obſervation, or to raiſe great expectation, as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite doth: Rather, as <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when <hi>ſhe had conceived, hid her ſelf five moneths,</hi> that ſhe might be ſure ſhe was with childe, by feeling <hi>the babe ſtirre in her wombe,</hi>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 4.19</note>. But when he once perceiveth the babe to ſtirre, he boldly then profeſſeth it to all the world, not ſo much in words, as in his actions, which ſpeak it louder than his tongue; <hi>Depart from me ye evil-doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſ. 119 115</note>.</p>
                     <p>And when he once begins this courſe, he never layes it aſide, but ſtill goes on; not only to renew repentance every day, for daily ſins and infirmities; but to make further progreſſe in his firſt repentance for thoſe ſins which he knoweth to be pardoned: as <hi>David,</hi> that repented truly, when <hi>Nathan</hi> firſt reproved him, and had his pardon; yet his tears then ſhed, were but a few inconſiderable drops in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe floods that followed after, witneſſe not only his watering his couch with his teares, and <hi>making his bed to ſwim</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 6.6</note>; but his many penitential Pſalmes afterwards penned chiefly, if not wholly upon that occaſion. And this he knowes to be the courſe preſcribed of God unto all true penitents, even <hi>when he is pacified towards them</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 16.63</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> convicted of ſin, and threatned with judgement, affected with it at preſent, and craves the <hi>prayers</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Church for him that none of the things threatned might befal him<note n="l" place="margin">Acts 8.24</note>, but never did more, and therefore eſcaped not: the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who ſo deſires the prayers of the Church<note n="m" place="margin">2 King. 19.4</note>, that he neglects not to pray and to humble himſelf effectually till God ſpeak peace and deliverance<note n="n" place="margin">Ver. 14, 15</note>.

                     <p>He hath found by woful experience the miſchief of deferring execution upon ſin, what devices it uſeth to obtain a pardon, if firſt it can get but a reprive. <hi>Joab</hi> knew what danger was to tarry diſcourſing but a few minutes with the man that told him of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> hanging by the haire in an oak, and pleading againſt the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him; therefore abruptly breaks off, telling the man, <hi>I may not tarry thus with thee,</hi> and <hi>takes three darts, and thruſt them thorough the heart of Abſalom</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 18.14</note>. So the true Penitent diſpatcheth ſin out of the way with the firſt, not admit of quarter, delay, or ſo much as a parley.</p>
                     <p>He conſidereth firſt, that repentance is Gods gift, not in mans power, no more than to keep the whole Law: and that it is no leſſe impoſſible to repent, without God, than <hi>to need no repentance.</hi> That it is not a, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> but an heart throughly pierced and grieved for ſin in Gods behalf, that defineth repentance. A gift then it is, and that of God; for, 'tis he <hi>that gives repentance unto Iſrael</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 5.31</note>, even <hi>repentance unto life</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 11.18</note>. It is a gift, purely Evangelical, that is ſupernatural, not like the remainders of the Law firſt engraffed in mans firſt Creation, in the hearts of all men by nature. And however the heart may be convinced, terrified and tortured by natural conſcience, as <hi>Judas</hi> was, yet it can never diſſolve into god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow, nor turn from iniquity, without this gift from God. The heart of man is like a ſpring-lock that can ſhut of it ſelf, it can accuſe, and ſhut under the hatches of condemnation, but it can never open to comfort, or converſion, without the Key of <hi>David,</hi> the grace of the Goſpel. Therefore repentance is ſaid <hi>to be a ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, given</hi> only <hi>to the houſe of David, and the inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Zech. 12.10</note>, that is, to the elect of God.</p>
                     <p>Next, he obſerveth, that late repentance is like late husbandry, which ſeldome
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63232:211"/> yields any conſiderable crop: that it is ſeldom ſound, or laſting. For the moſt part it comes forth when a man can ſin no longer, and proceedeth from an heart, not humbled for ſin, but hampered or diſabled that it cannot ſin; therefore late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſeldom findes acceptance with God, no more than the giving the dregs of age to the Prince, when the beſt wine of youth hath been conſumed upon Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. <hi>Alexander</hi> caſhiered the ſouldier that had his armour to ſeek till he was to fight: and the Lord excludes thoſe idle and careleſſe Virgins, that had their oile to ſeek when their lamps were to be lighted<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 25.10</note>, albeit they had a purpoſe to get oyle, and went about it too, when it was too late. God will not alwayes wait on him that ſtill thinks he may wait a little longer; and commonly, where he hath waited longeſt, he gives very ſhort warning, when he is reſolved to wait no longer, but comes on the ſudden, and is gone as ſuddenly, as he came. So that for the moſt part, ſuch dallying delaying penitents fall ſhort of repentance, and drop into hell, even when now they think to repent in earneſt.</p>
                     <p>Some have repented in age, and very late, who have been received to mercy: but we reade not of any that being called of God, and promiſing to repent, put off repentance from youth till age, and then repented. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> tarried out till the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh houre, but yet delayed not ſcarce a minute after he was called. I dare not think that <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſo good a man, would be careleſſe of training <hi>up his children in the feare and nurture of the Lord;</hi> and that, his ſon <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> although young when his father died, was altogether without admonitions, reproofs, and calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by the Prophets; which he did withſtand, and <hi>would not hearken to the Word of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">2 Chro. 33.10</note>, yet afterwards repented, and that effectually. How long he ſtood out againſt God is not recorded: the Hebrew Doctors ſay, he reigned wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly twenty two years, in his twenty third he was carried to <hi>Babylon;</hi> and, in the ſame yeare, repented and returned: but this was no ordinary thing, nor ſuch a Preſident as may warrant other ſinners to defer repentance. For uſually, dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance proceedeth from a dead heart frighted by the apprehenſion of wrath, and ſo dieth with the party without hope of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Yea, he further wiſely conſidereth that if he cannot riſe up and repent with this load already on his back, how ſhall he be able to do it afterwards when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heavier? If he cannot break this cord of ſin, how ſhall he do when it is doubled, and at length grown up to a cable? Therefore the true Convert haſteth, as <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> at the call of Chriſt<note n="f" place="margin">Euke 19.5, 6</note>; and followeth as cloſe as the <hi>eccho,</hi> the <hi>voice</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 27 8</note>. Yea, he cutteth cable in caſe of great danger when God raiſeth a tempeſt for his ſins becauſe he cannot tarry to weigh anchor in a ſtorme. He will part with any thing now, to ſave the ſhip and himſelf. He fleeth from ſin as from a <hi>ſerpent</hi> under his feet, <hi>which biteth</hi> ſo ſoon as it toucheth him<note n="h" place="margin">Eccluſ. 21.2</note>. As a Doe from the Hunter, and as a bird from the Fowler. If he repented not in youth he is ſorry that it was paſt before his calling; yet while the Lord doth call, he is careful <hi>not to harden his heart.</hi> He bringeth his veſſel while it raineth, not truſting to an after-ſhower. He had need make haſte, becauſe he knoweth that his Better, yea, his Maker tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the leiſure of his repentance<note n="i" place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as the ſluggard, that, take him when you will, he ſtill cries, <hi>yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 6.10</note>. Or, if he riſe and get up, he is like St. <hi>George</hi> on horſeback, that never rideth; the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Samuel,</hi> that at the firſt call, which be underſtandeth he ſaith, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Sam. 3.10</note>. The one is as <hi>Nabal</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrite when after his delayes he comes to repent, his repentance is but an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, not a ceaſing from ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As friends take leave, but with hope to meet again; and lovers fall out, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not to make up the breach again. So this hypocrite quarrels with, and takes
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63232:211"/> leave of ſin, but with hope of meeting again, and of a reconciliation. His repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is but a qualme that will ſoon be over; momentany, not perpetual. As <hi>when the unclean ſpirit went out of the man, ſeeking reſt</hi> elſewhere, but <hi>found none</hi> like that he had in his firſt entertainer, there was both in the devil an intent to re. turn, and in the man a deſire to receive him, whereupon <hi>he brought with him ſeven ſpirits more wicked then himſelf, and they all enter in and dwell there,</hi> whereby <hi>the laſt state of that man it worſe then the firſt;</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 12.43, &amp;c.</note> Even ſo it is with this hypocrite; He never parts with a Devil, or a luſt, but as an hoſt with his gueſt; he hopes it will not be long, ere he ſhall ſee him again, and tells him he ſhall be very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                     <p>Thus he is as they who make a Popiſh ſhew of holineſſe in <hi>Lent,</hi> weare black, abſtain from Playes, and perhaps from the more wanton Concomitants of them, and ſeem very devout, that as the poor ignorant Papiſts were wont to offer an egge at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> they may put on a new face upon the old heart, becauſe they are to receive the Sacrament: but it is but as the Snake, that being to engender with the Lamprey, caſteth out her poiſon and after licks it up again; for ſo theſe mimical penitents, after the Sacrament, return to their wonted malice, riot, luſt, as eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, more greedily than before. I condemn not all ſet times appropriated to holy buſineſſes, becauſe, if the times be left wholly arbitrary, moſt men will never ſee time to ſet about them. But, to put off all to thoſe ſet times is a fearful, yet common ſin of ignorant and ſuperſtitious Formaliſts in Religion, that at ſuch times put on <hi>a forme of godlineſſe, but deny</hi> and perſecute <hi>the power thereof</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5</note> all the year after.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved by the enemies of the Chriſtian name, that the Papiſts (for, Turks know no other Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Sands Relat.</note> but ſuch as border neareſt unto them) are never ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious as towards the time of ſhrift. Whence that Proverb is riſe among the Turks, <hi>That the Christians are mad once a year, and then by strawing aſhes on their heads, they recover their wits again.</hi> It is too true of too many others that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Proteſtants; ſometimes they ſeem very demure and penitent, for the times ſake, rather than for Gods ſake, or their own: but, that time being over, none ſo profane and diſſolute. And ſo it is with ſuch, as with him that being ſurcharged, can vomit and rid his ſtomack, what cares he for a ſurfeit? But in thus doing, he obtains not mercy; for, <hi>ſubſannat patientiam Dei,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> he laughs to ſcorne the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Penitent ſo departeth from ſin, as never, by his good-will,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>to entertain it again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may hang about his doors in a ſculking way, watch an opportunity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſlip in, and do him ſome miſchief too, ere he be aware; and haunt him, as evil ſpirits ſo haunt ſome houſes that the inhabitants can ſeldome be quiet for them; But he looks upon ſin, as upon the Devil. When he parts with it, he gives it a bill of divorce, never to return, at leaſt, never to be entertained as the wife of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, as in former times. He will not allow it ſo much as the leaſt alimony. By the Law of Divorce, no man might receive back a wife, once ſent out of his houſe by a bill of divorcement, although it were not for adultery, but he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>abomination before the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 24.4</note>, and <hi>greatly defiled the whole land</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 3.1</note>. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent therefore is very careful not to admit a divorced luſt, but for ever to ſhut the doors of his heart againſt it, as remembring with grief how often he hath offended by it.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth that <hi>God ſpeaketh peace unto his people, and to his Saints:</hi> but it is on condition, <hi>they return not again to folly</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 85.5</note>. He that looks upon ſin as <hi>folly,</hi> will not eaſily be reconciled to it, after once he hath found the fooliſhneſſe of it, and ſent it packing: eſpecially, if he hath ſmarted for it. He then ſaith unto God as <hi>Ezra; after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſſe. —Should we again break thy commandment, — Wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Ezr. 9.13, 14</note>? He remembreth the charge given by his Lord both to the cripple at the <hi>pool of Betheſda,</hi>

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Jer. 3.22</note>. It is this conſideration that moſt ſtrongly draws him, that the <hi>Lord is his God.</hi> Not that he hath not <hi>ſome eye to the recompence of reward</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 119.67</note>. Thus God deals with his own, as ſome Creditors with a Chapman that is broken by ſome accident, he ſets him up again, yea, makes him a gainer by his loſſes; and, thereby at length recovers his own.</p>
                     <p>Some have indeed held out from returning to God, until he hath cauſed them to <hi>ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, and to be bound in affliction and iron</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 107.10</note>. Yet have truly and ſavingly ſought the Lord in their diſtreſſe, and have been pardoned and delivered as <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and divers others: but this hath not been from affliction it ſelf, but from Gods ſanctification thereof unto them: but not all that then ſeek the Lord, do ſo ſeek, or ſo finde.</p>
                     <p>Affliction in it ſelf doth not make men better, but worſe, it neither ſofteneth the heart, nor openeth the eare: men may be puniſhed by affliction, but not reformed; ſubdued, but not reconciled. When <hi>Iſrael had played the harlot and done ſhamefully,</hi> God <hi>hedg'd her way with thornes, and made a wall that ſhe ſhould not finde her paths:</hi> but then ſhe <hi>followed after her lovers,</hi> as leudly and more madly than before<note n="g" place="margin">Hoſ. 2.6, 7</note>. Thus <hi>Ahaz, in the time of his diſtreſſe, treſpaſſed yet more againſt the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">2 Chro 28.22</note>. And no wonder, for, <hi>the wicked is like the raging ſea, whoſe waters caſt out mire and dirt</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 57.20</note>. The ſea caſteth out mire and dirt at all times, but much more in a ſtorme, <hi>when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor doth the hypocrite ſeek God in affliction as the child of God doth. The hypocrite ſeeks to God for <hi>outward</hi> eaſe and relief, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ahab;</hi> or for an outward bleſſing, as <hi>Eſau:</hi> but the godly, for pardon of ſin, mortification and ſpiritual grace eſpecially, when driven to God by outward troubles. <hi>David</hi> was more importunate for pardon, and cleanſing from guilt and ſin, than to be freed from outward ſhame, or from the ſword threatned to his houſe for his <hi>ſlaying of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah.</hi> The hypocrite is all for removing the preſent plague, the true Convert, though perhaps he firſt was driven unto God by the whip of tribulation, that he might be delivered; yet, being come, he findes other work to do, and other ſuits to prefer that may make way for this: as namely, that God would waſh him from his ſin, take away his hard heart, open his blinde eyes, deaf eares, ſubdue his love of the world, and of himſelf; and, for theſe ends, he endureth afflictions, and bleſſeth God for them, and prayeth rather for the ſanctifying, than removal of them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the hypocrite, even in affliction, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> cometh too late for the true, the beſt bleſſing: and when 'tis too late, then though he ſeek God early, and out-ſtrip others in outward addreſſes; yet, ſaith God, <hi>he ſhall not finde me</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 1.28</note>; but, as Chriſt told the unbelieving Jewes, <hi>ſhall die in his ſins</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">John 8.24</note>: The true Iſraelite <hi>ſeeketh the Lord while he may be found, and calleth upon him while he is near</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 55.6</note>: and thence <hi>it comes to paſſe that before he calleth,</hi> God <hi>anſwereth; and while he is yet ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the Lord <hi>will hear</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 65.24</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like a malefactour in a Goale, that never cares for the King or his favour, till he be in danger of the halter; the true Convert returneth unto God when effectually called, whether in affliction or not. The one in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on runs to God, when all other meanes faile him, as <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Witch at Endor</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 28.8</note>, to ſee what he can do for him; the other, in his trouble goeth unto God for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, more than for deliverance from the fruits of ſin; the one ſeeks for eaſe, the other for the profit of afflictions.</p>

                     <p>He is in and out, off and on; now he ſeeks, now he ſhuns the face of God.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Iſa. 33.14</note>: for, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that never feareth to commit ſin, unleſſe when ſome judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is threatned, cannot but feare when ſin is committed, and conſcience awakened. All ſinners are afraid: but, much more <hi>ſinners in Zion,</hi> becauſe there, <hi>God ſhineth</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 50.2</note>; yea, burneth<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12.29</note>, where he meets with ſuch <hi>briars and thornes,</hi> as this hypocrite <hi>ſets againſt him in battel</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 27.4</note>. He is bold and fool-hardie to commit ſin, whereby he provoketh God, and bids him battel; and then, ſo ſoon as he findes God muſtering his forces, ſo to be in his march againſt him, his <hi>belly trembleth,</hi> his <hi>lips quiver,</hi> and <hi>rottenneſſe entreth into his bones,</hi> not in hope as <hi>Habakkuk</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Hab. 3.16</note>; but as deſpairing of mercy, and crying out, <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But his feare of God is not on Gods ſide, but againſt him, and is an enemie both to God and himſelf. For, it is under the command and ſervice of ſinne, which firſt allures, and then affrights, like <hi>the old Prophet of Bethel,</hi> that firſt by a lie, drew the man of God, who had prophecied againſt <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Altar, to eat bread in his houſe, contrary to Gods command<note n="i" place="margin">1 Kings 13.18</note>, and then prophecieth ſharply againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Prophet for diſobeying the voice of the Lord<note n="k" place="margin">Ver. 20, 21</note>. This feare is no help to prevent or cure ſin, as in the godly; but a meanes to encreaſe, and aggravate ſin; putting him upon the committing of new ſinnes, out of a vain hope of avoiding ſhame or other puniſhment for ſinnes formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Feare, in a Chriſtian, makes him to take part with God,</hi>

                        <hi>againſt ſinne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In him, fear is a grace, that promoteth the ſervice of God, and the exerciſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; <hi>In thy fear I will worſhip,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> It is a barre to ſinne, not an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, a remedy againſt ſin, not an incentive to it, as we ſee in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſolicited by his whoriſh Miſtreſſe; <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin against God</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 39.9</note>? The feare of God made him to look upon it as a <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> as a <hi>great</hi> wickedneſſe, as a ſin againſt his Maker, as well as againſt his Maſter; and all this puts him upon an Interrogation, <hi>How can I do it?</hi> which argues an abhorrencie as well as a refuſal of it.</p>
                     <p>Feare quickens him to ſerve God, and orders him in his rejoycing, whereby he may do both to the honour of God. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>

                        <hi>genius</hi> of it; <hi>the feare of the Lord is to hate evil, pride, arrogancie, and the evil way</hi>

So much feare of God, ſo much hatred of ſin, as contrary to the true feare of God: ſo much freedome from pride, arrogancie, and every evil way, becauſe fear makes humble, meek, and careful in all things to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>He putteth on <hi>preſumption,</hi> as a cloak. If God ſend his ſervants to threaten him for his wickedneſſe, in ſtead of <hi>trembling at his Word,</hi> he makes a piſh at it; and <hi>when he heareth the words of the Curſe, he bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 29.19</note>. He builds high on a ſandy foundation. His preſumption is all he hath to plead for his deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and this is no other, as one ſaith, than hope out of her wits: yet this makes him to adventure upon any thing, although it hath in it more of hazard than of uſe, or hope: ſo that till God hath beaten him out of all his <hi>confidences,</hi> and made him to finde by experience that <hi>he ſhall not proſper in them</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 2.37</note>, he is reſolved not to feare.</p>
                     <p>If God let him alone for a while in his ſin, without puniſhment, he boldly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets Gods ſilence, as a connivance at, if not allowance of his wickedneſſe. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and I kept ſilence: and thou thoughteſt that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch a one as thy ſelf</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 50.21</note>. God did it, to ſee if he would feare him, and by repentance prevent the plagues; but this he never meant. <hi>Have not I held my peace,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and thou fearest me not</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 51.11</note>? And ſo, he verifieth that obſervation of the Preacher; <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to do evil</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Eccl. 8.12</note>; and hence, when once frozen in their dregs, <hi>they ſay in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil</hi>

I have fellowes enow, ſaith he; I do no more than all the world in their times have done before, and daily do before my face: Will God deſtroy ſo many millions for ever, for a trifle, a ſmall fault, (for ſo he accounts all ſins that he hath a mind to) ſcarce worth the talking of? Therefore, as malefactors, (if many) uſe to grow confident of a general pardon; ſo this hypocrite growes bold, upon the innumerable company of offendors in the ſame kinde, not to trouble himſelf for what he hath done, nor to be afraid of going on in the ſame courſe. This, he the rather doth, as perſwaded of his own power to repent when he will, and throw off ſin when ever he pleaſeth; and as applying promiſes, and only the promiſes of mercy;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63232:217"/> (God is merciful, and Chriſt came to ſave ſinners,) whereas the portion of ſuch, are threatnings only, and no promiſes of mercy.

                     <p>It is his ſtudy. <hi>He is devoted to it</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 119.38</note>. It is his choice, <hi>unite my heart, that I may feare thy Name</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 86.11</note>. It is his treaſure: he <hi>ſearcheth for wiſdom as for hidden treaſures,</hi> to this very end, that he may <hi>underſtand the feare of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 2.5</note>, that he may know both the excellency, and the uſe of it. If it be otherwiſe with him, he complaineth of himſelf: for no man feareth death more than he feareth hardneſſe of heart: Yea, he expoſtulateth with God himſelf, ſo often as he feeles that God reſtraineth the ſweet influence of his Spirit in putting his feare into his heart, <hi>Why haſt thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our hearts from thy feare</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Iſa. 63.17</note>? This the Church doth, <hi>not charging God fooliſhly,</hi> as if he led them out of the way, or put any ſinful quality into them, which cauſed hardneſſe of heart; but, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning her ſelf for giving God cauſe to leave her to the wandrings of her own ſpirit, and to that natural frame of heart, that is apt to harden it more and more.</p>
                     <p>He feareth God upon deliberation, as that by which he ſteereth all his actions. Therefore <hi>Joſeph,</hi> after he had put all his brethren into ward three dayes, as <hi>Spies,</hi> to make them taſte of his power, who had made him to feel their tyranny, he at length reſolves upon a more milde proceeding, ſaying unto them, <hi>This do, and live, for I feare God</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 42.18</note>. However they had uſed him when he was in their power, <hi>the feare of God</hi> made him to deal otherwiſe with them, when they were in his. This <hi>feare</hi> is his character by which he would be known, as appeareth in <hi>Job;</hi> his friends caſting this in his teeth, <hi>Is not this thy feare, thy confidence, the uprightneſſe of thy wayes, and thy hope</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Job 4.6</note>? He had given out, that he feared God, and he did ſo; and upon that ground, he had promiſed much unto himſelf from God, and laid up much hope in God, and walked uprightly before him. And now being under a world of calamities, his friends upbraid him with his <hi>feare of God,</hi> as being not ſincere, but hypocritical and falſe; as concluding that, if it were not ſo, theſe loſſes and miſeries ſhould never have befallen him; whereas, on the contrary, God ſuffered the Devil to lay all this upon him for the trial of his ſincerity<note n="s" place="margin">Job 1.8, 9, 10 11, 12</note>. The fear of God is his life and livelihood.

But, if the lawes, power, or wrath of man be likely to reach him, he looks about him; although not without regret, that he is kept in awe.

But man he feareth, becauſe he ſeeth daily how ſtrict he is with others; and that, many times, <hi>his tender mercies are cruel.</hi> He knoweth that <hi>the wrath of a King is as the roaring of a Lion</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 7.11</note>, he regardeth not, <hi>becauſe there is no feare of God before his eyes: for he flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 36.1, 2</note>. He flattereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with hope of impunity, becauſe he is ſure no eye of man ſees, and therefore no

                     <p>If he cannot promiſe himſelf impunity from man, who <hi>beareth not the ſword in vain:</hi> he then <hi>feareth;</hi> but, it is <hi>becauſe of wrath,</hi> not <hi>for conſcience ſake</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 13.4, 5</note>. And it is juſt with God, that he that will not feare God, ſhall be made to feare ſomething elſe: yea, he that feareth not God, feareth every thing elſe. Thus, when <hi>Cain</hi> had caſt off the feare of God, the feare of man, like a tyrant, ſeiſed on him, making him to complain to God, when it was too late, <hi>every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 4.14</note>. His own guilt makes him to imagine, that he that had murdered his own brother, ſhould himſelf meet with a murderer in every place. And rather than he will <hi>chooſe the feare of the Lord,</hi> he will yet proceed ſo far in evil, as that the Lord will force him to feare other things ſo much, as to <hi>flee, when no man purſueth</hi>

                     <p>This God doth for the good of humane ſociety, that the feare of man ſhould fall upon him that will not feare God. This is a ſnaffle for wicked doers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain at leaſt, ſuch as hate to be reformed<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 13.11</note>: and it is a ſnare (rather than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative) to himſelf that thus feares man, and will not feare God, making ſuch a Coward deſperate, and too boldly to ruſh on the pikes of Gods diſpleaſure, while he obeyeth man, even againſt God himſelf, to avoid the diſpleaſure of man.</p>

                     <p>He feareth God, even when he needeth not to feare men, but could make them to be afraid of him. He will not do evil, although for advantage, and with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of impunity from man: he will do good, though with danger and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from man, becauſe he feareth God; as <hi>Daniel,</hi> in continuing his ſupplications to God, even when man had made a ſharp Law againſt it<note n="k" place="margin">Dan. 6, 10</note>. He ſo feareth God, that he <hi>alone is his feare</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 8.13</note>, when others would make him afraid of fearing God.

                        <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 12.4, 5</note>. As one nail driveth out another, ſo Gods feare driveth out the unwarrantable feare of man. Therefore, the Chriſtian feareth God, that he may not be afraid of man, commanding things contrary unto God.</p>
                     <p>The true feare of God devoures in him all falſe feares, as <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> turned into <hi>a Serpent,</hi> ſwallowed all the counterfeit ſerpents of the Magicians<note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 7.12</note>. The feare of man doth but deferre an evil work, for want of opportunity to commit it; but the true feare of God correcteth the very evil intent, as well as the act it ſelf; yea, though there be opportunity, impunity, and advantage alſo: as we ſee in <hi>Joſeph</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the leud requeſt of his wanton Miſtreſſe<note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 39.9</note>. He therefore ſets up the <hi>feare of God</hi> in his heart, that he may not only do no evil, but hate it: and that this feare may caſt out all baſe feares out of his heart, which might, in the leaſt, deterre him from good, or fright him into evil.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> that <hi>hearing what Joſhua had done to Jericho, and to Ai,</hi> made <hi>a league with him</hi>

                        <hi>This hypocrites feare is ſlaviſh and legal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is natural to all men (Chriſt himſelf not excepted) to feare harme, paine, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and whatſoever is an enemy to Nature. Nature it ſelf recoileth and ſtarteth back from whatſoever annoyeth it. This is a feare that is incident to the godly, as well as to the wicked: and is not the feare that is here intended. This, man was endowed with in his Creation, and is no fruit of his tranſgreſſion, in the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>There is a feare alſo that is natural to all ſinners, to feare and ſhun Gods Preſence and Juſtice, as <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo ſoon as he incurred guilt, he purchaſed ſhame and feare, and <hi>hid himſelf</hi> from God<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 3.10</note>. <hi>Cain,</hi> after did the like: and ſo will all, till <hi>God ſpeak peace by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Natural conſcience alone is able to conjure up this ſpirit, when none elſe accuſeth, if permitted to do its office<note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 2.15</note>: how much more when God, by the operation of his own Spirit arraigneth the ſinner, cauſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to give in evidence according to the Law, and convincing the ſinner by the light of the Law, that he is in himſelf a loſt man, that can expect nothing but hell and damnation as the fruit and wages of his ſins.</p>
                     <p>This is that <hi>legal and ſervile feare,</hi> that makes men to ſee their bondage to ſin and Satan, and to feare God as ſlaves that expect nothing but the whip, or halter: This the Holy Ghoſt worketh, by ſetting on the terrours of the Law upon the tranſgreſſors of it, and awakening and inciting conſcience to affright and terrifie the ſinner, that he may go out of himſelf, and ſeek remedy in Chriſt, or periſh for ever. And for this, is the Holy Ghoſt called <hi>a ſpirit of bondage,</hi> which cauſeth <hi>fear</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 8.15</note>, and <hi>torment</hi>

                     <p>But, the feare of the <hi>hypocrite</hi> is yet, in the iſſue at leaſt, more ſlaviſh than that of the common ſinner, when after all his trifling and dallying with God, God preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, as <hi>a devouring fire,</hi> and as <hi>everlasting burnings</hi> to his ſoule<note n="w" place="margin">Iſa. 33 14</note>, that hath ſinned againſt knowledge, and againſt the light not only of nature and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but of the Law, yea, and of the Spirit of illumination it ſelf<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 6 4</note>. Then he comes to be afraid with a witneſſe: and the more, becauſe <hi>a ſinner of Zion,</hi> that <hi>in the land of uprightneſſe hath dealt unjuſtly</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Iſa. 26.10</note>; even when he profeſſed to walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and pretended to be a great ſervant of the Lord.

                     <p>He firſt underwent the ſpirit of bondage, and hath taſted deeply of legal feare in his firſt repentance and converſion: nor is he yet wholly freed from it, becauſe ſtill clogg'd with remains of corruption: for, ſin not being perfectly aboliſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be abſolutely pacified; yea, any ſin in him creates him more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent convulſion fits of feare, than to other men who have not taſted ſo largely of the love of Chriſt. Therefore he ſaith unto God, <hi>my fleſh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 119</note>, and prayeth, <hi>in wrath remember mercy</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Hab. 3.2</note>. But there is great oddes between him and the hypocrite, in the matter of his feare.</p>
                     <p>It is in the Chriſtian ever mixed with filial fear, which makes him to feare God as a Father, with more care, and ſo gets into the room of the other feare which can no more have entire poſſeſſion of him. This legal feare is not now his temper, but an accident; not his food, but his medicine. It maketh way not for deſparation, as in the wicked, whoſe feare ſhall come upon them; but for a further work of the Spirit of adoption, and liberty, giving him, upon the renewing of his repentance, new evidence of Gods love in the pardon of the ſin that did affright him, and more ſtrength againſt it for the time to come. It is as the needle to make way for that thread by which he is more ſtrongly faſtened unto Chriſt: by bondage he comes to liberty, by doubting to aſſurance, by legal terrours to Evangelical conſolations.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuch a feare as drives him, not from God, as it did <hi>Adam,</hi> but unto God, as we ſee in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who though he were faine to cry out, <hi>I exceedingly tremble and quake</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 12.21</note>, yet he drew nearer unto God, when God commanded his approach<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 19.20</note>; And even when he ſaith, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of polluted lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hostes</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 6.5, 7</note>; yet he ſtarted not, but ſtayed by it, until he had received a gracious anſwer, <hi>thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 6.5, 7</note>. Although he be too weak to conteſt with God, yet he flieth not, but layeth hold on mercy, and is forgiven his iniquity. So that, this return of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal feare, at times, to the Chriſtian, is but as the Shepherds dog, that never is let looſe upon him, but when he ſtrugleth; and then, perhaps, nips him by the leg, but teares not out his throat. It may make him ſmart, but not wound him; or if it bite deep, yet the wound is healed, before it be feſtered; and, he is made a gainer by it, before he part with it.</p>
                     <p>For however, legal feares may ſometimes, haunt a Chriſtian, like a fury; eſpecially when he growes careleſſe, and apt to back-ſliding; yet, even after deliverance from Gods wrath, by the blood of Chriſt, and the evidence of pardon witneſſed by his Spirit, it is not incongruous, nor unprofitable for him to fear. For, whether he conſider the caſe in which he once was, feare ends not with the danger; nor ſhame, with the pardon of ſin<note n="g" place="margin">Ezek. 16.63</note>. Even among the effects and teſtimonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>feare</hi> hath her place<note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11</note>. <hi>Caſſander</hi> is reported to have trembled at the ſight of the Statue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he was now dead, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and Dominion of all <hi>Greece:</hi> ſo the Chriſtian, when the quarrel is taken up by Chriſt, the conflict of conſcience ended, and all reconciled, is yet ſometimes <hi>troubled</hi> at the <hi>remembrance of God,</hi> even <hi>when he is pacified towards him</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 77.3</note>. Or, whether he conſider his preſent condition, he is not without cauſe of feare, for that he dares not ſtand to a legal trial, when he is at his very beſt<note n="k" place="margin">Pſ. 130.3.143, 2</note>: nor is he at all times ſure that he hath arguments enow to aſſure himſelf that judgement belongs not to him: his ſalvation is not finiſhed without feare and trembling. Much is required to anſwer Satan and his own conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be able to maſter all doubts about his <hi>tranſlation from death to life.</hi> To ſay nothing of his beholding the judgements of God upon others, and to hear the threatnings thundred out againſt ſuch as he is not able to accuſe of halfe the evils that he knows by himſelfe. <hi>If the Lion roare, who will not feare</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Amos 3.8.</note>? If the father be angry with his ſervant, the childe cannot but tremble.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, even at his loweſt ebbe, and ſtrongeſt paroxyſme of feare, filial feare hath ever the rule of his heart. His feare is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite feareth God, as <hi>Saul</hi> feared the Philiſtines, ready to break in upon him<note n="n" place="margin">1 Sam. 13.12</note>; the other feareth God, as the Iſraelites <hi>feared Joſhua, all the dayes of his life</hi>

                     <p>It is a ſudden fright, rather then a ſetled feare: and he is ſcared, rather than humbled. When God flaſheth terrours in his face, he is then low before the Lord, as <hi>Ahab,</hi> threatned by <hi>Elijah</hi>

He is alwayes afraid to offend, even while he offendeth: and if his feare be not ſtrong enough to keep him from offending, yet it faileth not to make him careful to reconcile himſelf unto God.</p>
                     <p>Thus, feare in this hypocrite, maketh an inroad, or ſudden incurſion, where it intends not to ſtay; feare in the true Chriſtian is as a ſtanding garriſon that is never removed. In the one, feare is as the muſhroom that ſhoots up in a night, and dies before the next evening; in the other, it is as the fire of the Sanctuary that was never to go out.</p>

                     <p>He feareth God, as a malefactor feareth the Judge: not as fearing to commit ſin, but as afraid of puniſhment for ſin committed.

                     <p>He is affected to Gods juſtice, as malefactors are to the juſtice of their Prince; not to love them for it, but rather to hate them for feare thereof, wiſhing to him, and it, weak hands, blinde eyes, or lame feet, rather than labouring to avoid that which may make him to fall under it. Or, if he be afraid of ſin, it is only for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which it draws after it. He would not feare ſin, unleſſe he were to feele the ſmart of it. Sin is to his pallate a ſweet morſel, which he likes well; but, if he forbear it, it is for feare the reckoning will be too heavy.

To him there is no judgement ſo great as the want of grace, and eſpecially of the feare of God. Take this from him, by the want whereof he ſhould go aſtray from God, and he accounts himſelf undone.

                     <p>Patience delivers him up to God, to be at his diſpoſe, to bear any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any honour redounds to God. He will not be his own carver, unleſſe to <hi>chooſe to fall into Gods own hand, rather than into the hands of men</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14</note>. He will not indent with God, what he ſhall ſuffer, or how long. Let God inflict both what he will, and as long as he will. He conditioneth not to be kept from this affliction, or that trouble: to ſuffer in his goods, not in his skin or carcaſſe; for a day, or ſhort time, but not longer.</p>
                     <p>If God ſuffer him to be loaden with reproaches unjuſtly, he beares it. <hi>If his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary write a book againſt him, he will take it upon his ſhoulder, and binde it as a Crown unto him</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Job 31.35</note>. He remembreth who hath ſaid, <hi>Feare not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Iſa. 51.7</note>. Not that he ſleighteth reproaches caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for ſin: for, theſe he prayeth againſt<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 119.22</note>: Nor reproaches caſt upon God, for theſe do even <hi>break his heart,</hi> he cannot bear them<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal 69.20 and ver. 9</note>. But he accounts that reproach precious which falls upon him for well-doing, or <hi>for the Name of Chriſt;</hi> therein he accounts himſelf happy, <hi>as having the Spirit of glory and of God reſting upon him</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 20.25</note>.</p>
                     <p>He ſeeketh not affliction, neither will he ſhun it. If the ſoreſt plagues befal him, he will chooſe rather to die under them, than by death of his procuring rid himſelf of them. He will not turne himſelfe out of Gods ſervice to ſave his life<note n="d" place="margin">Acts 20.25</note>, but rather rejoyce to part with it in, or for Gods ſervice, and rejoyce to ſee it ſo well beſtowed<note n="e" place="margin">Phil. 1.17</note>. He accounteth it great impatience to deſire to die, to be freed of Gods ſervice, or of ſuffering for it: but, to procure death, upon ſuch account, he abhorreth it as manifeſt rebellion. This were to yield up the Kings fort, for fear of a ſiege.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite in ſeeming to abound in patience, by bearing even death it ſelf of his own inflicting, to avoid a leſſe evil impoſed by others, ſhewes the greateſt impatience; being able to bear nothing but what he liſt, not unlike <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> who choſe rather to end his dayes in an halter, than to bear the diſgrace of not giving good counſel<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 17.23</note>, The true Chriſtian patience appeareth moſt, in not daring to do
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:63232:223"/> any ſinful act, to avoid the heavieſt trouble laid on him by God; but, as <hi>Job,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres the motion, by whomſoever made, and whatever he ſuffer: The patience of the one is but Cowardiſe made deſperate; the patience of the other prevents deſperate courſes of Cowards.</p>

                     <p>It is a needleſſe, or cauſeleſſe, (and therefore bootleſſe) patience. Either vain-glory, or the ſtrong and bewitching perſuaſions of others (for their own ends) maketh him deſirous, and ambitious to ſuffer; as the Popiſh Pſeudo-Martyrs who pretended ſuffering for their Religion (or rather ſuperſtition) when all wiſe men know they are executed for treaſon; and as they, whoſe affectation of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the Apoſtle hinteth, where, he ſaith, <hi>though I give my body to be burnt</hi>

Not much unlike to this, was that counterfeit patience of <hi>Cato,</hi> who being by one abuſed, that ask't him pardon, denied that he had done him any wrong; that he might not be thought to be at all moved at it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſometimes this hypocrite takes himſelf to be patient, becauſe, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, he fights not, nor uſeth all the extremity that he could, when yet his ſpeech, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and behaviour argue an heart boiling with unquietneſſe and envie within, as <hi>Abſaloms</hi> did towards <hi>Amnon.</hi> For though he ſeemed to pacifie <hi>Tamar,</hi> whom <hi>Amnon</hi> had raviſhed; <hi>Hold now thy peace my Siſter, he is thy brother, regard not this thing</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">2 Sam. 13.20</note>; and, in ſhew, took no notice of it to <hi>Amnon</hi> himſelf, <hi>ſpeaking to him neither good nor bad,</hi> for <hi>two yeares</hi> together<note n="x" place="margin">Ver. 22, 23</note>; yet he hated <hi>Amnon,</hi> becauſe he had forced his Siſter.

                     <p>Sometimes his patience is nothing but ſtoutneſſe of heart, that for reputation of magnanimity, will not take knowledge of an injury, as <hi>Saul,</hi> when ſome <hi>children of Belial</hi> after his election to be King, ſaid, <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us, and deſpiſed him, bringing him no Preſents; Saul held his peace</hi>

                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>true Chriſtian patience baniſheth pride and rancour,</hi>

                        <hi>and doth good for evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Chriſtians patience comes down from above, and therefore is like the founder:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63232:224"/> It accounteth <hi>pride and rancour,</hi> (the hypocrites ſupporters) to be as great enemies, as <hi>revenge</hi> it ſelfe; <hi>the patient in ſpirit</hi> being oppoſed, and preferred to the <hi>proud in ſpirit</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 7.8</note>. The patient Chriſtian doth not only ſuffer at the hands of his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, without ſeeking revenge; but, <hi>prayeth for them, and bleſſeth thoſe that curſe him:</hi> Yea, <hi>he bleſſeth, and curſeth not</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12.14</note>. This he accounteth to be <hi>thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience towards God, endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.19</note>. Patience is much miſtaken; much belongeth thereunto, which the world little thinks of. Patience can never <hi>have her perfect work,</hi> without <hi>wiſdom;</hi> no <hi>wiſdom</hi> is to be had without <hi>prayer;</hi> no prayer, without faith<note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4, 5, 6</note>.</p>
                     <p>And as patience is the gift of God, ſo is it the Chriſtians conformity with the perfection of his <hi>heavenly Father</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5.48</note>, a main part of the imitation, and a fruit of the Spirit of Chriſt<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4.32</note>. Magnanimity maketh a faire ſhew of patience, yet it is but a vizar of pride put upon the ſpirit of revenge: for ſuch men, ſparing in their retail, promiſe themſelves revenge in the groſſe: as <hi>Haman,</hi> by forbearing <hi>Mordecai</hi> made way to the deſtruction of the whole Nation of the Jewes: and <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeemed very patient towards <hi>Cato,</hi> and ſundry other particular perſons, without revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on them for oppoſing his ambition, that he might with leſſe envie, bring under his yoke the whole Romane Empire.</p>
                     <p>A baſe minde may beare quietly, becauſe it apprehendeth not the injury. The weak and impotent is wiſe enough to ſee the wrong, but dares not to take notice of it: the ſtrong can contemn, or deferre, or put it in the deck; but not digeſt it. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true Chriſtian truly <hi>overcometh evil with goodneſſe,</hi> by patient bearing the evil, and cordial doing of good.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is a Court-enemy, that is quiet and ſtill till he be able to ſtrike home to purpoſe. The true Chriſtian is the true friend that then ſheweth moſt patience when he is able to take ſharpeſt revenge: the one as <hi>Haman, thinks ſcorne to lay hands on Mordecai alone,</hi> without deſtroying the whole race of his people<note n="g" place="margin">Eſth. 3.6</note>; the other is as <hi>David,</hi> that ſpareth his mortal perſecutor <hi>Saul,</hi> even when it was in his power to kill him<note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 26.8, 9</note>. The one ſuppreſſeth his wrath, to give it more vent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; the other only attaineth that glorious victory, of an enemy to make a friend, not only to himſelf, but to Chriſt alſo, for whom he patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>If there be no way to avoid it, no revenge to be taken, he ſeemeth patient, and to be quiet; but, his patience is no other than a fretting, pouting patience; which the leſſe it breaks forth in action, ſpeech, or geſture, the more he inwardly chafeth, and ſuffereth the fire of vexation even to conſume his heart. Perſwade him to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, his anſwer is, <hi>What would you have me do? I neither fight, nor chide, I ſay nothing, &amp;c.</hi> When every one that ſeeth him may behold in his countenance, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough of fretting within. And, he that <hi>fretteth, doth evil,</hi> and doth not <hi>ceaſe from anger, nor forſake wrath</hi>

                     <p>He ſuffereth by compulſion, as a malefactour that quietly lies down upon the block, without reſiſtance, or ſhew of impatiency, but it is becauſe he cannot avoid it: he knows if he did not ſo, he ſhould be compelled: and ſo he is quiet, not from any ground of patience; but, partly out of ſhame leaſt it be ſaid of him, he was afraid to die; and partly out of ſelf-love to avoid greater torment in dying. Thus any man may quietly ſuffer poverty, ſickneſſe, death it ſelf, quietly, when there is no remedy; yet be far from beating any of theſe with patience, even when he ſeems moſt patient.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>tribulation</hi> which <hi>bringeth forth patience,</hi> makes him by <hi>experience,</hi> to arrive at <hi>hope,</hi> which <hi>maketh not aſhamed</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 4, 5</note>. This can never be but where affliction is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: but, being ſanctified, <hi>patience</hi> will ſoon <hi>have her perfect work.</hi> For then, the Chriſtian ſees love in correction<note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 3.12</note>, and finds profit by ſuffering<note n="m" place="margin">Pſ. 19.67, 71, 75</note>.

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 12.10</note>, therefore he <hi>fainteth not, when chastiſed by him,</hi> but kiſſeth the rod, as bleſſing God for it.</p>

                     <p>This patience makes him keep the peace alſo, not only with others, but with his own heart. For, while he <hi>waiteth patiently upon the Lord,</hi> he will <hi>not fret himſelf becauſe of him that proſpereth in his way</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 37.7</note>; he preſerveth the tranquillity of his minde, as well as his charity; not only not revenging, nor reviling, but forgiving, and loving his enemies, yea, praying for them. By this meanes is he Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in the way to maſter others, that otherwiſe could maſter him, upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account that he is not his own Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> whom <hi>Pilates</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers <hi>compelled to beare the Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> when <hi>they led him forth to crucifie him</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 27.32</note>, he was forced to do it whether he would or not: the true Chriſtians patience is like that of his Lord, who when he was to undergo the ſharpeſt brunt, profeſſed to his Father, <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O my God</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 40.84</note>: the one puts on the garment of patience, as a malefactor, his ſhrowd, or winding ſheet, when he is going to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; the other puts it on as an ornament wherein he delighteth always to be found.</p>

                     <p>He will ſo endure, that he will not omit to complain he is wronged, or at leaſt accounts himſelf ſo to be, although, perhaps not injur'd at all. Either he ſuffers wrong, or would be thought ſo to do. And this he will take notice of, that you may take notice of his patience; although his very complaining argues the contrary. Sometimes he forbears not God himſelf, as if God had dealt but hardly with him: and then, he commendeth his own patience, by ſaying, <hi>I am a poor man, I take it patiently;</hi> when yet his wealth is more than he will be known of, or than he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well to employ. And as for his neighbour, he ſaith of him, <hi>he hath done me wrong; but I muſt forgive, and forget;</hi> when yet no wrong is done, but ſome juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof perhaps is given him, or he hath recovered his own, wrongfully detained by this patient wrong doer.</p>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Col. 3.13</note>. And as for God, he reſolves neither to open his mouth, nor to beare the leaſt grudge in his heart againſt him, let God deal how he will by him. He will juſtifie God againſt all the objections of his own heart, <hi>The Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doth</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Dan. 9.14</note>. <hi>It is his mercy that we are not conſumed</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Lam. 3.22</note>. And unto men, rather than hold contention, he ſaith, <hi>I am as ye are, ye have not injured me at all</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Gal. 4.12</note>. He rather burieth the wrong as having not been at all, than to maintain a juſt quarrel any longer with them. At leaſt he committeth all to God, his cauſe, his ſoul, and all, in well doing, not in a way of quarrelling. For well he knoweth, that, <hi>Patientiae Sequeſter Deus,</hi> God is the Solicitor for patience, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh) with whom he is ſure he may ſafely truſt both himſelf and cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> quarrelling with <hi>Gideon,</hi> even when they had cauſe to thank him<note n="x" place="margin">Judg. 8.1</note>.

                     <p>The Chriſtian will patiently ſuffer, when, after a lawful defence, he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf overborne by injuſtice and violence: but he will omit nothing that is honeſt and lawful to prevent an unjuſt ſuffering, Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> who was <hi>ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Hieruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> omitted nothing that might make for his juſt defence againſt unjuſt proceedings; as a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> he might plead his <hi>Burgeſſeſhip</hi> of <hi>Rome; Is it lawful for you to ſcourge a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and uncondemned</hi>

Afterwards, when the High Prieſt commanded him, contrary to Law, to be ſmitten on the mouth, <hi>Paul</hi> made ſo bold as to tell him, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall: for, ſitteſt thou to judge me after the Law, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt me to be ſmitten contrary to the Law</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of the Aſſe, that lets fall his eares when his back is over-loaded, and ſtandeth ſtill while the Wolf worrieth him; the patience of the other, is like that of <hi>Abner</hi>

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Prov. 23.34</note>; and ſo to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelf by one blaſt to be thrown over into the ſea while he is ſleeping, than to be at the labour of coming down while he is awake.</p>
                     <p>This luskiſh diſpoſition this hypocrite would have to be taken for patience, for his patience conſiſteth of nothing elſe. If he be in an Office, or a Magiſtrate, his careleſneſſe and dulneſſe in puniſhing offendors muſt be interpreted gentleneſſe and compaſſion, meekneſſe and long ſuffering, whereas indeed this is meerly a neglect of publick good, to gratifie his own private eaſe and ſloth: and he declareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is more a friend to wickedneſſe, than a mirrour of patience; and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer the diſeaſe to ſpread, than to ſtir up himſelf to apply the remedy: when he in his own private caſe can be vindictive enough. So it often happeneth, if he be in the Miniſtry, that he may be accounted milde, and patient, he will rather let his people die quietly in their ſins, than trouble himſelf or them ſo farre, as to give them ſuch a rowſing warning as God requireth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes there is another reaſon of this kinde of patience, which the world is not aware of, as bad as the other. For, if by juſt occaſion he be put upon the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf from ſome foule imputations, he will ſeem to bear that reproach (whcih he calls injurious) with patience, rather than be troubled to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: whereas indeed it concerneth him much, to endure an uncertain report, rather than by ſtirring too farre, to bring the truth of his wickedneſſe to light, whereof before there was no certain proof. Therefore he rather preferreth a ſelf-guilty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which is a cleanly meanes to avoid the diſcovery of guilt, to a diligent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>true Chriſtian patience is active and diligent.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever comes from the Spirit muſt needs be of an active nature: therefore, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if true. This makes a man as careful to do the Will of God in what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him to be done, as to ſuffer the Will of God by exerciſe of his patience, in bearing what God impoſeth. Patience hath her work<note n="q" place="margin">Jam. 1.4 <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The Chriſtian will not therefore be ſo ambitious of the name of a patient man, as to be without the nature. He neglecteth not publick ſervice, although it ſhould be much to the diſturbance of the patience of others, to preſerve his own quiet and ſecurity. In his own perſonal wrongs he uſeth patience, as the beſt remedy, if there be hope of cure; but, where the wrong concerneth God, or the publick, he accounteth it a ſin to uſe more patience than by Law is preſcribed. Therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in place of Government, <hi>he ſcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Prov. 20.26</note>: yea, he maketh haſte to cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord<note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 101.8</note>. And, being a Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>he cannot bear them that are evil</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Rev. 2.2</note>; but, with the <hi>two-edged ſword</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline, executeth upon them the judgement written</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of <hi>Gallio,</hi> that, when the Peace was broken before his face, at the very Judgement-ſeat, <hi>cared for none of theſe things</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Acts 18.17</note>.

                        <note n="y" place="margin">Neh. 13.25</note>, he being a Magiſtrate, and their Governour: the patience of the one is like that or <hi>Judah,</hi> who when newes was brought him that his daughter-in-law <hi>Tamar was with childe by whoredom,</hi> his ſentence was, <hi>bring her forth, and let her be burned</hi>

                     <p>He rejoyceth to part with nature for grace, with blinde eyes for ſeeing eyes, with his native pride for better fruits; <hi>miratúrque novas frondes, &amp; non ſua poma.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires the new leaves and fruit that grow on his wither'd ſtock: and ſaith with joy <hi>in his heart,</hi> in reference to ſpiritual generation of new graces in his ſoul, <hi>who hath begotten me theſe; ſeeing I have loſt my children, and am deſolate, a captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving to and fro?

                     <p>The Will and Commandment of God is both his ground, and rule of obedience. He doth it becauſe God will have it done, and as God will have it done.

                     <p>The ſame man before his Converſion, went to Church for company; here was a good act, but an ill ground: after his Converſion, he goes out of conſcience. Here both act and ground are warrantable, and ſo the action is good. He is careful to know the Will of God, not of himſelf, or of humane directors, but of God himſelf. It is true that God teacheth by man, but then man teacheth from God. And ſo God <hi>ſheweth</hi> and he learneth <hi>what is good, and what the Lord requireth of him</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite obeyeth God, as the Clock ſtriketh, when forced by the poiſe or weight from without; the true Chriſtian obeyeth, as the pulſe of the body beateth, becauſe of the vital ſpirits in the artery within: The one receives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from men, and ſo marreth a good action, for want of Commiſſion; the other doth all by order from God, and ſo cannot miſcarry in the work.</p>

                     <p>If natural actions that are of neceſſity have a pleaſure in them, as eating and ſuch like, much more unto a Chriſtian partaker of the godly nature, it is a pleaſant thing to obey God in ſpiritual ſervice: being in his proportion made like unto Chriſt, who made it <hi>his meat and drink to do the Will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">John 4.34</note>. <hi>Love,</hi> to a Chriſtian, is both the ſumme and end of the Commandment, <hi>the fulfilling of the Law</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 13.10</note>.

The one will obey when forced by God, the other holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound by neceſſity to ſerve him willingly, when furtheſt off from force.

                     <p>If he preach, it is ſo coldly, dully, careleſly, that whatever the matter be, he marres it in the careleſſe managing of it.

                     <p>Yea, if the work be not none at all, an excuſe will ſerve his turne as well; and indeed there is little odds between them, ſave only that the excuſe may perhaps put him to more paines, than ever he meant to have taken in doing of the work.

                     <p>To do the work commanded, is his full reſolution: this he will do, whatever it coſt him. He will rather loſe his life than omit it. But, remembring that Word of the Lord, <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully,</hi> or <hi>negligently</hi>

                     <p>He is his own end, and therefore muſt advance that, although God go by the loſſe. He is not ſo careful that the thing be done, as that he may have the honour of doing of it.

                        <hi>Alexander</hi> was angry at the multitude of his fathers victories, when himſelf was yet but a youth, leſt no work ſhould be left for him to raiſe his name above his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo, this hypocrite is offended with his neighbours vertues, that may threaten an eclipſe to him. He differs not from thoſe Heathens, who followed vertue meerly for advantage, and admiration; and, who if they wanted a Trumpet fit to ſound forth their praiſes, they accounted themſelves but ill rewarded; being ready to ſay with <hi>Alexander</hi> (than whom never any lift up his head more lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily upon the Theatre of honour) <hi>Quid narras, niſi Homerum revixiſſe?</hi> He cared for no mans diſcourſe of his actions, unleſſe he could bring him newes of <hi>Homers</hi> being alive again, to ſet them out.

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 6.2, 5, 16</note>: and if they ſee not, he thinks his labour loſt.</p>
                     <p>If he have parts beyond others, or but thinks he hath, no mean, or obſcure place will hold him. He needeth not others to prompt or adviſe him, <hi>to depart thence</hi> to ſome other place, where his abilities may be more noted, and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. And therefore he likes well that counſel (although carnal) given by Chriſts brethren to him; <hi>Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy diſciples alſo may ſee
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:63232:233"/> the works that thou doeſt. For there is no man that doth any thing in ſecret, and he himſelf ſeeketh to be known openly. If thou do theſe things, ſhew thy ſelf to the world</hi>

                     <p>But when he comes to the height of pride, when his obedience or works have raiſed in him an opinion of merit: for now he preſumeth himſelf able to pay the Lord for what he taketh, and to ſatisfie for any thing wherein he hath offended, and to do, not only all that is required of God, that he may not ſtand in need of his mercy; but, to do more than is commanded, that he may purchaſe mercy for others alſo. And to ſay truth, there is ſcarce an hypocrite in the world, but is, in this point, a Papiſt, in heart. For this is an opinion, wherein all hypocrites unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agree. The more is this proud ſin to be abhorred. And, whoſoever (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, or not) ſeeketh his own glory is a Competitor, yea, a Rival with God: nor is the difference much, whether he extol merit, ability, or grace it ſelfe, for commendation of himſelf or others, rather than for the glory of the Author.</p>

He will ſooner deny the work that he doth, than aſſume, or ſuffer, the glory of it. He did it for God, and none but God ſhall wear the honour. He knoweth that all other ingredients cannot make a good work, where this is wanting; without this, he that is moſt fruitful in works, (which men may call good) is unto God a barren tree. <hi>The trees of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> which are of the <hi>Lords planting</hi> yield no fruit, but that wherein <hi>he may be glorified</hi>

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 5.16</note>, not him. This is his end in believing, praying, doing, ſuffering, all things; and held out ſo clearly to all, that none can eaſily (unleſſe wilfully) miſtake him. To this, all other ends, (as the benefit of his brethren, yea, the ſealing of his own ſalvation, and adorning of the Goſpel) are ſubſervient, and do homage. He not only doth the things commanded, but when he hath done all, he openly confeſſeth, he is <hi>an unprofitable ſervant</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 115.1</note>, to whom no thanks is or can be due for any thing that he doth.

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 115.1</note>; and, <hi>God be merciful unto me a ſinner,</hi> even when perhaps he hath as ſtrenuouſly laboured in Gods work, as ever <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did<note n="i" place="margin">Neh. 19.22</note>. He is as much afraid of ſuch praiſes, as an honeſt man is of receiving ſtollen-goods.</p>
                     <p>He doth not ſhun, but purſue <hi>things that are of good report</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 4.8</note>; not to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he doth them, but, for his honour, by whoſe <hi>ſtrength he performes them</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Vee. 13</note>. He will <hi>do good works</hi> that <hi>may be ſeen,</hi> for example, and for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; not that he <hi>may be ſeen,</hi> and praiſed for them. He cares not how much himſelf lies hid, ſo the work it ſelf may appear to Gods glory. The conſcience of his duty is enough to him. He is for the work, not for the proclaiming of it. If the work appear, he will take care, not to ſhare in the glory. He will raiſe as much glory to God as he can by doing good. His hand ſhall be in the work, but none of the honour ſhall ſtick to his fingers.</p>
                     <p>If any praiſe be forced upon him, he may, and will thereby take encouragement to deſerve more, but not be lifted up, nor take any thing of Gods due, whoever ſhall tempt him to it. He ſeeks not praiſe, but rather ſhuns it; and, the more he ſhuns it, the more ſedulouſly he purſueth whatever is praiſe-worthy. He admitteth
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:63232:233"/> not all the commendations that ſome men would heap upon him, nor will he wholly reject ſome acknowledgements, ſo far as it may ſtand with their good, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him; becauſe men will be the ſooner drawn to imitate ſuch a pattern as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves account ſo worthy of praiſe.</p>
                     <p>He is not ſo ambitious as to engroſſe all good works into his own hand, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is willing others ſhould <hi>work the work of the Lord as well as he</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 16.10</note>. Therefore what he doth openly, is as much for their incitement to <hi>go and do likewiſe</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 10 37</note>, as for diſcharge of his own duty. If God deny him opportunity to do ſome good work which he hath in his eye, and deſire, he had much rather others ſhould do it, than it ſhould not be done. If God think not fit to let <hi>Moſes</hi> have the honour of leading <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan, Moſes</hi> is well content that <hi>Joſhuah</hi> do it. If God declare that <hi>David</hi> ſhall not build him an <hi>Houſe,</hi> he is ſo far from envying <hi>Solomon</hi> whom God choſe to do it, that he who could not have the honour to do it himſelf, did gladly provide all the materials he could towards the doing of it. So farre will the Chriſtian be from hindring another, that he doth all he can to further him.</p>
                     <p>As for the point of <hi>merit,</hi> he abhorreth the very thought of earning, or being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with God. For well he knoweth who hath taught him in ſincerity to acknowledge, that, <hi>when he hath done all thoſe things which are commanded him, I am an unprofitable ſervant, I have done that which was my duty to do</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 17.10</note>. He is not ignorant, that no man keepeth his wife more charily, than God his honour, and that he will not part with the leaſt part thereof to any creature upon any termes. Therefore the Chriſtian will not be his Rival in this which is ſo precious to him. He will be very wary not to make him jealous in the leaſt of his going about to ſhare with him in that which would make his jealouſie <hi>burne unto the lowest hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite in all the good he doth, or pretends to do, is like <hi>Iſrael, an empty Vine, that bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf: according to the multitude of his fruit, he encreaſeth the Altars</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Hoſ. 10.1</note>, not to ſacrifice to God, but to himſelf: the true Chriſtian, when he hath done a good work, ſaith unto God, as ſometimes <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> touching <hi>the taking of Rabbah, do thou take the City, leſt I take it, and it be called after my name</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.28</note>.

                        <note n="r" place="margin">John 9.24</note>. But when they do any thing themſelves, they call for the <hi>trumpet</hi>

                     <p>This is a thing ſo well known to <hi>Satan,</hi> the father of this and all other hypocrites, that he would faine have faſtened this upon <hi>Job</hi> alſo; <hi>Doth Job feare God for nought?</hi> it was for <hi>the hedge God had made about him, his houſe and all that he had; and for bleſſing the work of his hands, and encreaſing his ſubſtance</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 20 7</note>. It is his grief that <hi>no man hath hired him,</hi> rather than that he hath too little for his work.

God will not then let his own work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pay. Therefore, if God give him <hi>his penny,</hi> he thankfully receiveth it; and when God promiſeth it, he accounts it no mercinarineſſe to have ſome reſpect, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, <hi>to the recompence of reward</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 11.26</note>. He is encouraged by hope of reward, yet worketh principally upon the ground of duty. He knoweth God cannot be loved, without reward; yet, he makes not the reward the ground of his love; for God is to be chiefly loved for himſelf, without any eye to the reward, which when the Chriſtian glanceth his eye upon, he loveth God more and better, whom he loves beſt for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite when God calls him to any work, ſaith in his heart unto God, as <hi>Judas</hi> to the Prieſts, <hi>What will ye give me</hi>

Words are the ſhadows of deeds, but his are words without deeds, ſhadows without a ſubſtance, which is ever prodigious: for every ſhadow that is natural, is the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, or iſſue of ſome ſubſtance. But here is no ſubſtance at all, but a meer painted ſhadow that ſerves only to ſet off a ſubſtance, as the hypocrite, that is but a foile, or ſhew, ſets off a true Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>He ſpeaketh well, and doth ill, and therefore alſo is an <hi>evil ſpeaker,</hi> becauſe his tongue belieth his heart. He ſaith, what he meaneth not, and doth not what he ſaith; and therefore he ſaith and doth not, becauſe he meaneth not as he ſaith. All hypocriſie is principally in the heart, for which, hypocrites are called, <hi>Hypocrites in heart,</hi> that <hi>heap up wrath</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Job 36.13</note>; they pull down wrath, not by ſmall parcels, but by <hi>heaps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this man is a double hypocrite: an hypocrite <hi>in tongue,</hi> and an hypocrite in heart. For his tongue belieth his heart, and his heart, his tongue, ſuffering his life to confute his tongue; and, ſo deceiveth others by his tongue; and himſelf by his heart. He maketh his tongue a faire ſigne to an empty ſhop, or as an Ivy Buſh to bad wines, to delude the buyer.</p>
                     <p>He is <hi>Pſittacus,</hi> a meer Parret in religion, that is ſtill pratling by rote the words of a Chriſtian, but not as a Chriſtian: a meer Jewes-trump, or a thing to make a noiſe with, on purpoſe to beguile. As thoſe Orators, whoſe chiefeſt perfection lies in <hi>Pronunciation,</hi> are more beholding to their lips, than to their braines; ſo is this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite more beholding to his tongue than to his heart. He is only a Speech-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, which when he hath ſaid, he hath done. He <hi>can ſpeak well</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 5.28</note>, but without an heart to do. Sometimes his tongue runs beyond his wit; but, alwayes beyond his heart. Sometimes he is for verboſity, as they that affect the <hi>French volubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> ſometimes, for taciturnity, as they who like better the <hi>Spaniſh gravity.</hi> He alwayes deceiveth, for he never ſpeaks as he meanes, nor meanes what he ſpeaks.</p>

                        <hi>the true Christians tongue is the true Interpreter of his heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He can ſpeak nothing but what his heart dictateth. His heart firſt enditeth, and then <hi>his tongue is the pen of a ready Writer</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 45.1</note>. As he that is a profeſt wicked man, by his tongue proclaims what is in his heart; <hi>(for, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh</hi>

                     <p>The tongue is the <hi>helme,</hi> or <hi>rudder</hi> of the whole man<note n="w" place="margin">Jam. 3.3, 4</note>, at this helme the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtian alwayes ſitteth, that he may <hi>bridle the whole body</hi>

                     <p>To offend ſometimes in tongue, is an infirmity incident to the beſt, becauſe the <hi>tongue is an unruly evil, that no man can throughly tame</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Jam. 3.8</note>, ſo that there is <hi>no man but offendeth in word</hi> and tongue. But the Chriſtian is not impotently given up to the licentiouſneſſe of the tongue, for, <hi>he is purpoſed that his mouth ſhall not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 17.3</note>. <hi>He taketh heed to his ways that he ſin not with his tongue,</hi> and <hi>keepeth his mouth with a bridle</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 39.1</note>. And becauſe, that only is well kept, which God keepeth, to his own induſtry, addeth prayer, <hi>Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 141.3</note>. But all this he doth to prevent the evil of the tongue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to ſuch as are openly wicked. He is careful alſo of thoſe evils that the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in heart venteth with his tongue, which is the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>He is as much afraid of ſpeaking good words in hypocriſie, as of <hi>ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.2</note>. He taketh care that his words be ſuch as they ought; and that they prove not <hi>winde;</hi> but, be ſeconded by action. As <hi>his ſpeech is alwayes with grace, ſeaſoned with ſalt</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 4.6</note>, ſo his actions are gracious, becauſe <hi>the ſalt</hi> which ſeaſoned his ſpeech, <hi>hath not loſt its ſavour.</hi> That <hi>Law of God</hi> which is <hi>in his heart,</hi> makes him <hi>not to refrain his lips;</hi> and, when the word is once gone out of his mouth, it will not be long ere the word be turned into works. Grace in his heart is a law to his lips, and his lips are an obligation upon his hands, whereupon enſueth obedience both in word and deed.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite aſpiring to <hi>ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels,</hi> is yet for want of works of love anſwerable to his words, <hi>but as ſounding braſſe, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymbal</hi>

Therefore his praiſe is to provoke others to the ſame practice of vertue, which he praiſeth: It is the good works done, not the workman, which he chiefly commendeth; not to make him proud, but to encite and engage him to do more, and better, and with ſome caution too (eſpecially when he ſeemes to foretel what ſuch an one will be, if he go on as he beginneth) as ſometimes <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> did, <hi>C.

And this humour poſſeſſeth many, who, having more learning than grace, ſharpen their wits to baffle thoſe who have more grace than learning, and by grace do ſhame them and all their learning. Sometimes pride breeds an itch in good parts, and, in men of great hopes, there is oft-times an humour of oppoſition, which being nouriſhed, breedeth opinionativeneſſe, and prophaneneſſe in the heart.

And there is nothing more dangerous in ſcholars of pregnant parts, and buſie wits, than to vaunt of a polemical, or rather parodoxical ability to defend any thing, though never ſo improbable; for hereby they come at length to hold any thing, although never ſo falſe and damnable; or to deny any thing, or to hold nothing, be it never ſo clear and demonſtrable.

A true man back't with a good conſcience and a good cauſe, ſometimes foiles a fencing thief; and a ſincere Chriſtian that loves the truth and peace, will keep his ground better in the defence of truth, than he that pretends to much more skill in diſputation: and though he ſpeak with leſſe Art, yet what he ſpeaketh is more to the purpoſe. And, if all things elſe faile, yet his faith and courage faile not; ſo that when he can anſwer ſophiſmes and fallacies no longer, he boldly reſolveth, as he that was over-match't by Popiſh Sophiſters, when he

Reputation with men, is his greateſt ambition, therefore he muſt ſeem better than others, that he may raiſe a name. But his carriage anſwereth not his high-flowen profeſſion; he ſometimes takes a cup too much, or is wanton, or uſeth ſome deceit in commerce, or is ſtrongly ſuſpected of ſome other miſcarriages, which not only blemiſh his reputation, but endanger
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63232:241"/> his perſon. Here, he is put to his ſhifts, whereof the firſt is a lie. He out-faceth that with a lie, ſo long as he is able, which he bluſhed not to do in hope of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered. He thinks to cover his fault by a lie, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did her fathers i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, by <hi>ſitting upon them</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 31.34</note>, and ſo by hiding it, doubles it. And indeed, lying is as common with him, as ſwearing is with a debauch't ruffian. He can as hardly ſpeak without a lie, as the other without an oath.</p>
                     <p>If he be ask't a queſtion of his carriage, not becoming his Profeſſion; or, for which he is afraid he ſhall be blamed, or ſhamed: his anſwer is no other than a lie. If he have been where he ſhould not, and done what he ought not, and after be asked, as <hi>Gebazi</hi> was, <hi>Whence comeſt thou?</hi> or, <hi>where haſt thou been?</hi> He hath a lie ready, <hi>thy ſervant went no whither</hi>

                     <p>If he have a minde to draw another, who makes Profeſſion of Religion as well as he, (and perhaps, with more ſincerity) into ſin, and the other alledgeth any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Lord againſt it, he will be lie God, and Scripture, and all to bring him to his lure, and make an hard ſhift to abuſe the other with a pretended warrant from God for ſo doing; as the old <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>Bethel,</hi> who abuſed the man of God that had prophecied againſt <hi>Jeroboams Altar;</hi> by cauſing him, contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Command of God, to return with him, and to eat bread, upon pretence that he, being a Prophet as well as the other, had received later order from God ſo to do; <hi>but he lied unto him</hi>

And this we know, that God likes no ſuch Advocate as liers to plead his cauſe. <hi>Will ye,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> to his three friends, <hi>ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</hi> Will ye make a lie for him, as one lieth for a man<note n="y" place="margin">Job 13.7. and ver. 4.</note>?

There are in Scripture divers things which the Proctors for lies, do urge as lies, which are not ſo. Every lier ſeeks to conceal truth, yet every one that concealeth truth is not a lier. <hi>Abraham</hi> concealed truth in not ſaying <hi>Sarah</hi> was his wife: but did not lie in ſaying ſhe was his ſiſter, for ſhe was his ſiſter by the fathers ſide<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 20.12</note>.

But he only ſaid, <hi>She is my ſiſter,</hi> and ſo ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from lying.</p>
                     <p>Again, Tropes or Figures, as alſo Parables which are frequently uſed in Scriptures, although not true in the very letter, are not lies, becauſe never intended to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but to ſignifie ſomewhat elſe by an elegancie of ſpeech, not by a fallacie of words; and ſo they are to be underſtood, and accordingly are interpreted by ſuch as underſtand language: ſo as here is no deception in the ſpeaker, but a more lively and profitable inſtruction of the hearers.</p>
                     <p>When Chriſt is ſaid to be a <hi>Rock</hi> a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> and when the devil is called alſo a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> a <hi>Dragon, Leviathan, &amp;c.</hi> no man is ſo weak as to take theſe ſpeeches to be meant properly, but figuratively, by way of alluſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; to ſhew the ſtrength and vertues of the one, and wickedneſſe of the other ſo fully in few words, as could hardly in many other plain words be ſo fully expreſſed. He therefore refuſeth not ſuch expreſſions, but rather ſtudieth how to make out the elegancy of them, and how, aptly to imitate the Holy Ghoſt in ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and ſimilitudes.</p>

                     <p>So for Parables, as that of <hi>Jotham,</hi> concerning <hi>the trees</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 15.2</note>; and thoſe many Parables of our Saviour in the Evangeliſts, although the things mentioned in them were never acted according to the letter, (which was never intended by them,) yet ſomething, like thoſe very things were acted by thoſe very perſons to whom thoſe parables were ſpoken, which had it been ſpoken in plain down-right language, would not have inſtructed them half ſo well, or ſo much. For thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables do hold forth them and their actions, in ſo clear and lively a glaſſe, as makes them to ſee themſelves and their actions ſo fully, as not to be able to evade the condemning of themſelves by their own judgment and conſcience, which otherwiſe could never be ſo convincingly done.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he uſeth Parables alſo, (yet farre from lying) when he is able ſo to frame them, that the true ſcope may both appear, and teach; and the words be ſo choſen and placed as an intelligent eare may diſcerne them to be a Parable, not a ſtory: <hi>nec invidentur diſcentibus, quod his modis obſcurantur, ſed commendantur ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis; ut quaſi ſubſtracta deſiderentur ardentius, &amp; inveniantur deſiderata jucundius</hi>

Nor are things of this nature enviouſly found fault withal, but rather commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch as are put to the paines to pick out the true meaning of them; when it appeareth, that therefore the things thereby intended, ſeem to be laid under para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical expreſſions, as it were out of ſight, that they may be ſought out with more diligence, and found with more pleaſure. And the ſcope, being once found, it will then appear, that thoſe parables contain not falſhoods, but truths, becauſe truths, not falſhoods were not only intended, but ſignified by them; and ſo, they are not only warrantable, but commendable, and very acceptable to an ingenuous hearer, or reader.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is hard to give him a right <hi>name;</hi> and therefore not eaſie to give him an apt <hi>deſcription.</hi> Whether he may be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed the <hi>Buſie Hypocrite,</hi> whoſe buſineſſe is idleneſſe; or, the <hi>Idle Hypocrite,</hi> whoſe idleneſſe is his buſineſſe, it is not eaſie to determine. For, either he ſets himſelf on work, but to no purpoſe; and ſo, his buſineſſe is no better than idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: or, he preſumes it is work enough for him to keep himſelf out of work; and ſo, his idleneſſe is his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>Hardly will the body poſſeſſed of an active ſpirit, be idle; but, never the minde: ſomething it will do. But, if that ſomething about which he buſieth himſelf be as good as nothing, I mean as bad, or rather ſomething worſe; we ſhall do him a favour, at leaſt a right, to account him idle; and, his occupation, an idleneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of buſineſſe; and rightly terme him, <hi>The idle Hypocrite:</hi> the <hi>buſie Idler,</hi> or the <hi>idle Buſie-body.</hi> He either doth nothing, and then, all his buſineſſe is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his idleneſſe: or, that which he doth, is worſe than if he did nothing, and ſo his buſineſſe is but idleneſſe.</p>
                     <p>One idleneſſe in him (which is the childe of ſloth, whereby he is without emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) begets another idleneſſe, which is the fruit of the former, opening the door to all manner of wickedneſſe. What the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of wanton women, is too true of men alſo, When <hi>they learn to be idle, they wander about from houſe to houſe;</hi> and are not <hi>only idle, but tatlers alſo, buſie-bodies, ſpeaking</hi> (and doing too) <hi>things which they ought not to do</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.13</note>. None <hi>walk ſo diſorderly,</hi> as <hi>they who work not at all,

                        <note n="b" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3 11</note>. So that he is never more idle, than when he is moſt buſie in that which idleneſſe ſets him upon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian is truly diligent, and conſtantly well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knoweth that God himſelf <hi>worketh</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">John 5.17</note>, and will admit of no loiterers and idle perſons about him<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 20.6</note>. He that will have his <hi>penny,</hi> muſt <hi>work in his vineyard.</hi> And he that <hi>worketh receiveth wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">John 4.36</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dares not be idle, nor ill employed. And <hi>he worketh the works of God,</hi> that is, ſuch as God alloweth and ſets him about, without picking and chooſing his own work. <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he unto God) <hi>wilt thou have me to do?</hi> No work ſeems amiſſe to him that is wholly for God. Nor will he, with the ſluggard, delay time, <hi>(yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep);</hi> But he <hi>worketh while it is day,</hi> before <hi>the night cometh, wherein no man can work</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">John 9.4</note>. He <hi>glorifieth God</hi> on earth, that he may be <hi>glorified by God in Heaven</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">John 17.4</note>.</p>
                     <p>He ſo emproveth time, and buſineſſe, that even his idleneſſe, (if I may ſo call his vacant houres) that is, his neceſſary reſt, his leiſure, is not without ſome dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; becauſe it tends to fit him for buſineſſe. He ſleeps, to riſe and go about his work, not to pamper ſloth; he eates, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, to walk in the ſtrength of his food, the way that God ſends him<note n="h" place="margin">1 King. 19.7, 8</note>, not to gratifie his throat, or belly. So, on the other ſide, his labour, in regard of contentment and delight in doing Gods Will, is unto him a reſt, being of the nature of Heaven, <hi>Coeli motus, quies:</hi> the reſt of Heaven is perpetual motion, which being interrupted would diſturb all. He is never better pleaſed than when God gives him his hands full of work; nor more reſtleſſe, than when God doth not employ him.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite embraceth idleneſſe as his work, and work, as his idleneſs: the true Chriſtian embraceth work as his meat, and ſhunneth idleneſſe as his bane: the one hath no buſineſſe, but his idleneſſe, the other hath no time for <hi>idleneſſe,</hi> for his buſineſſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He would work as hard as any man, if he durſt. But, to labour were as much as his life were worth: ſo ſloth pleadeth for him. As if health were to be preſerved by idleneſſe, the bane of health; or, eye-ſight, by continual winking. That with him is healthy, which deſtroyeth the end of health, emploiment for God. He dares not go <hi>to plow in winter</hi> for feare of cold<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 20 4</note>; <hi>habebit frigore febrim,</hi> the cold will bring an Ague upon him. Nor will he go abroad earlie, for feare of <hi>a Lion in the way</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Pro. 26.13, 14</note>, better lie a bed and turne <hi>as the door on the hinges, than be ſlain in the ſtreets.</hi> Better entertain poverty in bed, than an Ague in the field, or meet a Lion in the Wood. The way of duty is to him <hi>an hedge of thornes</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 15.19</note>; therefore he muſt tread gingerly, or not at all: yea, it is (by his telling) more than he can ſafely do, to pull his hand <hi>out of his boſome, to put it to his mouth,</hi> to feed himſelf; his hand may take more cold by the way, than his meat is worth<note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 9.24</note>,</p>
                     <p>How many ſuch hypocrites hath the Common-wealth, as well as the Church. Such are good, neither for <hi>Common,</hi> not <hi>private</hi> wealth: good for nothing, but <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges conſumere,</hi> to make riddance of what others provide, and to <hi>conſume</hi> Gods bleſſings <hi>upon their luſts</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Jam. 4.3</note>, which ſhould be emproved to his glory. For their own particular; If they eſcape <hi>cloathing with rags,</hi> yet it will not be long ere <hi>their houſe drop thorough,</hi> and that <hi>poverty come upon them as one that travelleth</hi> by the way, <hi>and their neceſſity as an armed man</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 6.11</note>. For the publick, they threaten to bring whole Nations under tribute to maintain their idleneſſe and voluptuouſneſſe. <hi>Plato</hi> compareth idleneſſe in a State, to phlegme and choler in the body, which are the common cauſes of all ſickneſſe. If ſo, then ſure our State hath much need of <hi>Agarick</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> if not <hi>Hellebore,</hi> to purge this peccant, lethargical, epidemical humour.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite is one of thoſe many in our Lords Vineyard, who are too ready to hearken to Satans counſel, <hi>Spare thy ſelf, ſhort not life with too much ſtudy and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63232:247"/> toile, take heed of a conſumption, &amp;c.</hi> He pretendeth age and infirmity diſabling from Gods work before he needeth, and maketh night before Sun-ſetting: as they that being to act a Comedy in the day, ſhut up the windows, and make an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial night. Or, he is of the minde of that ſlothful ſervant, who that his Lord (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) might be no loſer, wrapt up his talent in a napkin, and ſo made ſure that he ſhould be no gainer.</p>

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 13.4</note>. He knoweth Winter-husbandry to be moſt uſeful, although moſt painful. In Summer every ſluggard will with the ſnake, peep abroad. There are <hi>twelve houres</hi> in his day<note n="r" place="margin">Joh. 11.9</note>, and till they be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the Lions in the Wood or World ſhall not be able to worry him<note n="s" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.17, 18.</note>, nor the foxes to entrap him. He hath experience that, walking in Gods way he is in Gods keeping<note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 13.31 32.</note>. But, out of the way of duty, he may (like enough) meet with a <hi>Lion,</hi> as the diſobedient Prophet<note n="u" place="margin">1 Kings 13.24</note>: or, with a ſtorme, a wrack, a whale, as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive <hi>Jonah</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Jon. 1.17</note>, to ſwallow, not to ſave: but, walking diligently in his calling, he is within the hedge, and pale of Providence, and under the guard of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels<note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 34.7</note>.</p>
                     <p>He dreams not of eaſe till he hath done his work: then he is ſure to <hi>rest from his labours</hi> in the Heavens. Nor cares he to take up his reſt while he is in his journey, As he hath <hi>here do abiding City, but ſeeketh one to come</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 13.14</note>. So he feareth that doom, <hi>He that takes his eaſe in this world, ſhall travel in the next,</hi> He is more afraid of the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> if he ſhould <hi>lean upon the wall</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Amos 5.19</note>, as weary of work, than of a <hi>Lion,</hi> while he walketh in Gods way.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite works not for feare of danger; the true Chriſtian work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf out of danger: the one by his feare, pulleth upon him the thing feared, the other by his diligence, preventeth that feare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite is idle, that he may not be, nor thought to be, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</hi>

                     <p>Let him be but idle, and he will tell as faire a tale of ſelf-denial, in regard of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf great things; as if his idleneſſe were not a vice, making him to refuſe working; but, a vertue, forbearing work, to prevent the vice of the worldling. A mean, yea, poor eſtate, (forſooth) contents his moderate minde, not as ſeeking higher life; but, as chooſing rather a dogs life, with hunger and eaſe, than the life of the induſtrious Chriſtian, which abhors to be idle. He likes not thoſe that are ſo eager to earne and get, for he likes not the labour: <hi>from hand to mouth</hi> is as much as he ſeeks, for he is reſolved on his eaſe. And is it not a vertue to be content with ſmal meanes? yea, to be patient in poverty, rather than to be alwayes drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and toiling? Thus who ſo contented a man in ſhew, as our idle hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?</p>
                     <p>Indeed, idle perſons are ordinarily, for any act they do (ſaving for wiſhes) good-fellowes, and nearer of kin to the waſter<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 18.9</note>, than to the niggard. But, firſt, if at any time they chance to work, they ſet an higher price on their labour, than any diligent perſon can finde in his heart to do; becauſe it toiles their lazy bones more for want of uſe; and their little work muſt bear out a great time of idleneſſe both before and after. Next, if we enter into their thoughts and wiſhes, we ſhall finde them to covet more than any man can earne. The ſluggard, even when <hi>his hands refuſeth to labour, coveteth greedily all the day long; but the righteous giveth and ſpareth not</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 21.26</note>. And what is the iſſue but this, the one giveth, and hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 11.25</note>; the other wiſheth, and his ſoule hath nought. And, when that armed man comes indeed upon him, he finds it another manner of burden than he dream't of, to bear poverty. When the raine beats through the decayed roof, and the winde blowes thorough his ragged coat, when his garden yields him nothing but thornes and nettles, when he ſhall beg and no man take pity on him, and finde plenty of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63232:248"/> only one thing, poverty; then ſhall that come to paſſe, <hi>the deſire of the ſlothful ſlayeth him, becauſe his hands refuſe to labour</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 21.25</note>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the true Chriſtian laboureth that he may avoid covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſeeks to cut off vain wiſhings and wouldings, that he may not bring himſelf into the tentation of unneceſſary poverty, through his own default. He is afraid to eate the bread or idleneſſe, leſt it make him reliſh the bread of deceit, or of theft. For, if <hi>poverty</hi> even of Gods ſending doth occaſion men (through their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) <hi>to ſteal and take the Name of God in vain</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 30.9</note>: how much more when they bring it on themſelves? If it be ſo dangerous, as our portion here, how much more as our purchaſe! A Chriſtian therefore never takes himſelf to be out of the rank of <hi>thieves,</hi> until he <hi>labour with his hands the thing that is good</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4.28</note>: and he looks upon it as a tempting of God, to look for plenty without paines. Profit is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on labour; <hi>In all labour there is profit</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 14.23</note>. He will not therefore be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Providence, nor diſable himſelf for the bleſſing promiſed to labour. And, ſeeing the idle and confident never thrive, the diligent and diffident, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for he either thrives not, or thinks not that he thrives; the Chriſtian joynes diſcretion and faith to his diligence, and ſo is ſure of the bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite flying labour, falls into covetouſneſſe; the diligent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an avoideth covetouſneſſe by falling to his labour; the one the leſſe he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the more greedily he craveth; the other, the more diligence he uſeth, the leſſe ſatisfieth him.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He hath a large eſtate whereon to live without pains taking. He needeth not to ſpend more than what is his own already. Therefore he concludeth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not him to work. It is calling enough to look to what he hath, and to ſpend it nobly. Indeed there is a rank of people called the <hi>Gentry,</hi> whom I honour in regard of place, and many of them much more in regard of worth; and happy are the places where ſuch plants do grow. But I cannot but bewaile the abuſe of that, as of all other bleſſings and honours conferred on men, the generality of them being poſſeſt with this opinion, that ſuch muſt live at the height, and ſpend all their time in pleaſures and idleneſſe no way conducing to the common good, but much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of it; as if God, like <hi>Augustus</hi> had built an <hi>Apragopolis,</hi> a City void of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a nurſery of idleneſſe, for them here upon earth: or had made them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to play up and down the world, as <hi>Leviathan,</hi> upon the waters<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 104.26</note>.</p>
                     <p>But idleneſſe is tolerated only in the devils dominions, ſuch as <hi>Laiſh,</hi> where the <hi>people dwelt careleſſe, after the manner of the Zidonians quiet and ſecure,—and had no buſineſſe with any man</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Judg. 18 7</note>. But where God ruleth, and people own him for their God, it is otherwiſe. Never any man (I take it) had larger poſſeſſions than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> who was the only abſolute Monarch of the whole world; nor was any meer man more noble, for he is ſtiled <hi>the Sonne of God</hi>

                     <p>But this hypocrite is, for the moſt part, his own man (for, a ſervant to Chriſt, he is not:) he hath no body to controll him.

                     <p>Next, the eare is employed to liſten, and pricketh it ſelf up to hear any thing of others, but what it ſhould: for curious eares are compared to cupping-glaſſes, that draw out corrupt humours, rather than any thing elſe: or, to ſome gates in Cities, appointed for the paſſing out of malefactors. A ſcandalous tale, or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, an intelligence or occaſion of evil report is a feaſt to ſuch an eare. <hi>Darius</hi> entertained ſuch under the name of <hi>Otacoustes.</hi> Thus the Athenians buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>to hear and tell newes</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 17.21</note>.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tongue</hi> alſo is as buſie as either eye or eare, to enquire after work for this hypocrite. For the <hi>eare</hi> and the <hi>tongue</hi> do <hi>tradere operas mutuas,</hi> make work for one another. The tongue maketh enquiry, that the eare may have intelligence: and the intelligence by the eare, giveth the tongue matter of report. But againſt this, even the wiſer heathens have made ſundry Lawes. The <hi>Locrians</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> (that inhabited <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>) ſet a fine upon his head, who returning out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſhould immediately ask, <hi>What newes in the City;</hi> as laying a barre upon all curioſity and buſie intermedling of the tongue. The <hi>Thurians,</hi> (Citizens of <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> another City of <hi>Greece,</hi>) ſuffered none to be abuſed upon the ſtage, but adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and buſie-bodies; becauſe they would have theſe ſins throughly diſgraced. For curioſity is a kinde of incontinencie, and adultery is a kinde of curioſity; for, in both there is a ſinful endeavour to ſearch and know what they ſhould not.</p>
                     <p>It is an ill hound that followeth every by-ſent. And he is an ill member of a State, a Town, a Family, that pretendeth to know all newes that is ſtirring; what ſuch an one is worth; what he oweth; whence cometh ſuch a ſtranger; of what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, condition, &amp;c. and what he cometh for. He little conſidereth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the <hi>Egyptian</hi>-ſervant to him that asked him, <hi>What is that thou carriest covered?</hi> It is therefore covered that thou ſhouldeſt not know. He thinks he muſt know every thing, or he is no body; but this makes him to know ſo little of what he ought to know concerning himſelf.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite is like the Hen that loveth to ſcrape in the duſt, though ſhe hath corne enough before her. He hath work enough before him, and within him, yet he leaveth the enquiry into himſelf, and raketh the dunghil before other mens doors, that he may better conjecture what is in the houſe. Such an one doth more good to his enemy, than to himſelf: for him, he maketh more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. But, for himſelf, by clawing his own itching eare, he worketh ſmart as well to himſelf, as to others. In ſtead of wiſdom and knowledge, his minde is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and furniſhed with the ſhreds and rags of other mens tatter'd reputations: and, many times, (either by enquiring after his own fortune, as <hi>Saul</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam 28.19</note>, or by que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning about others, as <hi>Oedipus</hi>) he cometh to underſtand his own confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.11</note>. Not that he will not do buſineſſe for others, if deſired, and that it may be for their good: but all that he doth for himſelf, or others, is confined within the limits of his calling and duty. Neceſſity, or profit, tending to the good of all, are the things be aimeth at. He finds time little enough for <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> concerning life and godlineſſe; and, for profit whereby he may benefit himſelf and others, that he may not be altogether <hi>an unprofitable ſervant:</hi> to theſe, his heart often giveth him an <hi>Hoc age;</hi> or, do this with all intention of minde.</p>
                     <p>His eyes are in his head, and <hi>look right on, and his eye-lids look strait before him</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Prov. 4.25</note>: he doth not caſt his eyes on every ſide to buſie himſelf with every by-buſineſſe: or. if they go abroad, it is on Reaſons errand, when there is juſt cauſe ſo to do; to ſee for inſtruction, or to move compaſſion, not to feed curioſity, or to kindle luſt. And his errand being done, his eyes return, and keep home, as chaſte handmaids; and ſo they avoid <hi>Dinah</hi>'s danger, who by needleſſe wandring abroad came home deflowred. He hath learnt ſo much of a heathen, that there is nothing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:63232:252"/> than a rowling wandring eye that curioſity employeth. <hi>Cyrus</hi> being told that <hi>Panthea</hi> the wife of King <hi>Abradates,</hi> (whom among the <hi>Aſſyrians, Cyrus</hi> had conquered) was worthy his beholding, for that ſhe was exceeding faire; nay, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, quoth he, ſhe is the more dangerous to be lookt upon<note n="*" place="margin">Xenoph Poed. l. <hi>7.</hi>

                     <p>He is not like the <hi>Lamia's,</hi> blinde at home, and ſharp-ſighted abroad: he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blindfold abroad, and turneth his eyes inward. Of all objects, he liketh the true mirrour beſt, becauſe that ſheweth him himſelf, and that without flattery. If he look abroad, it is rather on <hi>the Sunne, the Moon, the Starres,</hi> and other works of God<note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 8.3</note>, than upon mens private behaviours. <hi>The Works of God are perfect</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 32.4</note>, and regular; whereas mens actions are irregular and exorbitant. He will look where he may profit himſelf; not vex himſelf.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>eares</hi> are chaſte (he being wedded to Chriſt:) He can heare no whiſperings againſt others, no more than he can heare flatteries of himſelf. He ſtoppeth his eares againſt the <hi>tale-bearer,</hi> and <hi>caſteth him out,</hi> and ſo cauſeth thoſe <hi>contentions</hi> which are on foot, <hi>to ceaſe</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Prov. 26.20</note>, and preventeth the beginning of more. If he hear any, it ſhall be God himſelf, by whomſoever ſpeaking to him. <hi>I will hear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what God the Lord will ſpeak</hi>

                     <p>He employeth his tongue, not to enquire after other men, or to ſpeak his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them, but to move queſtions of importance, that concern his own well-doing and welfare: Such as that of the Goaler, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 25.11</note> he is then willing to ſpeak, and to emprove his tongue to the utmoſt: in ſuch caſes he will not keep ſilence, until ſome body be the better for his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite makes himſelf buſie where he hath no work, that he may ſave himſelf the labour of working what belongs unto him; the true Chriſtian ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all by-buſineſſe, that he may work and finiſh the work which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to do: the one laboureth in vaine, and is puniſhed as a loiterer; the other worketh to purpoſe, and is rewarded for his labour.</p>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 10.26.</note>, that do but anger and vex him, for they would have gone but the <hi>ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards</hi> pace, and have wrought after his rate. Any thing, but what he ſhould, you may have of him; provided you expect nothing of what he ſhould performe. Let him do your work, and he will toile till he ſweat: put him upon his owne, and he puts his hand into his boſome. Any calling, any work, is better than his owne, therefore he employeth himſelf leaſt in his own calling, and beſtoweth moſt pains and time where he hath nothing to do.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the true Chriſtian keepeth cloſe to the works of his own cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that, as a Chriſtian, he ſeeketh ſpirituals before temporals, and will do Gods work before his own, and <hi>chooſeth the better part that ſhall not be taken from him</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note>. Here the things of the Kingdom of God, and of this world, cannot both be had, he preferreth the world to come, before this preſent world; and the <hi>Word of God, before his appointed food</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Job. 23.12.</note>, and will be aſhamed to be more verſt, and better skill'd in the affaires of the world, than in the things of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He leaves it to others to be more expert in the world, who have no other care, nor comfort. But in buſineſſe of his particular calling (the former being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preferred, as aboveſaid) he not only <hi>abideth with God,</hi> as not ſtarting from him, or it: but laboureth for God, that ſo he may pleaſe him that hath called him.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the many differences of outward things, he diſcerneth of thoſe that agree with his own place and calling: and ſets upon that chiefly which moſt concerneth
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:63232:254"/> him to look after, as being chiefly required of God in his place, upon conſcience of Gods Command, and for the good of humane ſociety. He worketh diligently in his own place; not becauſe he cannot play, or hath not wit enough to be idle; but becauſe he dareth not ſo to ſpend his time and ſtrength; and, as good be idle as to work where God hath not ſet him; or, in that work which God hath not cut out for him. He knoweth that recreation, though never ſo lawful, becometh an idleneſſe, when it is better loved than buſineſſe, and when it is uſed as neceſſary to paſſe away time, as if he were in great diſtreſſe to have ſome part of his life cut off: or when recreation is turned into an occupation, or uſed ſo, as one may ſay, <hi>If this be your recreation, what is your occupation? Plato</hi> reproved a young man for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Dice, to which the party anſwering, <hi>For how ſmall a matter do you reprove me!</hi> the Philoſopher replied; but <hi>the cuſtome is no ſmall thing</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Diog. Laert.</note>. And as he knoweth ſomething to be done better than recreation, (to fit him better, for which, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth recreation, but no further; ſo he employeth his mind and body ſo recreated and refreſhed in doing of his own work, or rather Gods, in his own calling, and to <hi>bring forth his own fruit</hi> unto God <hi>in his ſeaſon</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 1</note>.</p>
                     <p>'Tis enough for <hi>Eſau</hi> to tire himſelf in recreations, till he be almoſt dead, and ready to ſell his birth-right for a refection<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 25.32</note>. The Chriſtian knoweth better how to ſpend his time; not, by hunting abroad, but by working in his place: and that the wiſdom of a good man is much emproved by uſing well his ſpare houres. He looketh upon the world as <hi>a ſea wherein the Leviathan playeth</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 104 26</note>, the Embleme of Idlers; and the <hi>Merchants ſhip</hi> ſaileth<note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 31.14</note>, the Embleme of diligence. He likes of the Merchants trade better than that of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and prefers diligence in his own calling before all the ſport in the world. <hi>His meat and drink,</hi> and life too, <hi>is to do the Will of God</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">John 4.34</note>.</p>
                     <p>He differs from the hypocrite, as men differ from children; theſe go to ſchool, in hope of play; and thoſe play that they may fit themſelves for labour. He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth diligently, not as the covetous, to get wealth, but as a ſervant to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to the honour of Religion. If God give wealth, he refuſeth not, but putteth it to account, writing himſelf a debtor to God for it, and as truſted with the well-employing of it. As for men, he cannot finde in his heart to take all, and repay nothing. I have their hand, ſaith he, they muſt have my head: they labour for me, it is my part to ſtudy and care for them how to do them good<note n="o" place="margin">Pſ. 122.8, 9</note>.</p>
                     <p>And what he doth, even in earthly things, ſavours of an <hi>heavenly converſation</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Phil 3.20</note>. He doth outward buſineſſes, but with an heavenly and ſpiritual frame of heart. His heart is not taken up, nor taken away with the world, when he is moſt buſie in the things of the world. He <hi>ſetteth his affections on things above, and not on things on the earth</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 3.2</note>. He is an <hi>Adam</hi> that hath an earthly conſtitution, according to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his name; and, an earthly occupation, (wherein he honoureth God) according to his conſtitution; but not an earthly heart: for therein he beareth the Image of the <hi>Second Adam, which is from heaven heavenly,</hi> as he ſhall hereafter, in his body<note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.49</note>, when he comes to reap the full harveſt of all his labours.</p>
                     <p>In his outward labours, he is the more diligent, aiming at the gaining of time and liberty, for vacancy to holy duties. He worketh willingly, becauſe he worketh for God; but all is, that he may enjoy God. Therefore he ſo worketh, that he may ſpend as much time as poſſibly he can, in converſe with God, after his work is over. <hi>Jacob ſerved for a wife, and for a wife he kept ſheep</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Hoſ. 12.12</note>; but, it was <hi>becauſe he loved her</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 29.20</note>. So the Chriſtian ſerveth God in his place, be it in <hi>keeping ſheep,</hi> or what it will, that God ſetteth him about. And all the time he ſo ſerveth God, for God, <hi>ſeemeth to him but a few dayes, for the love he hath unto him.</hi> In the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes work he prepareth for the Sabbaths reſt; and daily ſo laboureth, that he may gain time to ſolace himſelf with the Lord in prayer, reading, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is a ſelf-will'd Iſraelite, that will work for God; but, that which he ſets him not about, at leaſt at that time, but expreſly forbiddeth him to meddle with. When God ſaith to <hi>Iſrael, Go not up, neither fight, for I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:63232:254"/> you,</hi> they will then <hi>preſumptuouſly go</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 2.42.43</note>. The true Chriſtian doth all with ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, as a faithful ſervant to his Maſter, or Lord, doing his Maſters work, not other mens, or his own; but, <hi>as the ſervant of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the heart</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Eph. 6.6</note>. The Chriſtian doth worldly things, as the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth ſpiritual; not by the eye, but by the by: the one ſitting at Church, thinketh of his dinner, the market, or his paſtime: the other ſitting at dinner, hath his heart at Church by meditating on the Sermon.</p>

For, well he conſidereth, that order in martial affaires, is of as great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ſtrength. Without this a Souldier may let in the enemy, and do more hurt than an enemy. And zeal out of courſe and order, lets in ſuperſtition, or will-worſhip, to the prejudice of the cauſe defended.</p>
                     <p>He emulateth others to over-take and out-go them in goodneſſe, without envying them<note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 9.2.</note>. He is <hi>jealous over them with a godly jealouſie,</hi> for feare they ſhould ſinne againſt Chriſt their Husband, by following others<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.2.</note>. There is in him a moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat of all the affections towards God and the Lord Jeſus; burning in his <hi>love</hi> to him, in <hi>longing</hi> after him, in <hi>joy</hi> in him, and <hi>indignation</hi> againſt all thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him. His zeale is not confined to love and anger, nor compounded of them; but is a gracious quality firing all the affections and paſſions in the behalf of God. 'Tis not the reſult of any one or moe affections, but a gallant temper in them; yet differing from them, as the due ſeaſoning of a knife or axe that makes it to cut excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, or as courage in a valiant man which is not a compounded thing of his paſſions and ſpirits, but a brave temper of both. It is in him a diſtinct grace of the Spirit, which makes him <hi>fervent in Spirit, in ſerving the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 12.11.</note>. Not a reſult of this or that grace or of many together, as ſpirits in the blood.</p>
                     <p>This his zeale makes him alſo <hi>jealous after a godly ſort</hi> over thoſe that he loves, leſt they, being brought into Chriſt, ſhould be defiled by ſeducers, or do any thing unworthy of their relation to Chriſt; he is ſolicitous and provident, leſt ſome evil ſhould diſturb the peace, or violate the purity of any that he loves upon that account. His love is the prime affection that provoketh his zeale, and makes him jealous; yet zeale alſo is that fire that kindles his love, and all his affections to make them fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently active for God; it is as the fire from heaven that kindled and burned <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and made it acceptable.</p>

But true zeale checketh it every way, both in our ſelves, and others; and ſets a pitch, to a mans ſelf in practiſe; to others, in example. True zeale is too buſie, not onely againſt evil, but for good, forcing men to drive beyond their pace. <hi>Lot,</hi> that was <hi>vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked</hi>

He ſeeth that the hypocrite hath nothing but fire-light, which more hurteth the eyes than helpeth his ſight: But the well-informed zealot, as he warmeth himſelf by the fire of zeale, ſo he worketh by the day light of knowledge, which directeth his zeale.

                     <p>Admirable was the wiſedome and judgement that guided the zeale of <hi>Paul,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving <hi>Peter to his face, becauſe he was to be blamed</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note>. He diſcerned, that though it were a good minde not to offend the tender conſciences of Beleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> in a point of legal diet, from which they were not throughly weaned; yet it was farre more dangerous to beget a ſcruple in the conſciences of converted Gentiles againſt the liberty of the Goſpel, wherein both they and the <hi>Jewes</hi> were to be confirmed, and wherein <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe was firſt inſtructed in a <hi>Viſion</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 10.12, 13, &amp;c.</note>. <hi>Peters</hi> fault was, that when none but Gentiles were preſent, he did all things which they did, making no diſtinction of meates: but when ſome <hi>Jewes</hi> came from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> being ſent to <hi>Antioch,</hi> by <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, who then reſided in <hi>Hieruſalem, Peter</hi> began now to be, or to ſeeme to be aſhamed, or afraid of what he had done: and therefore withdrew himſelf from the tables of the belieeving Gentiles, not daring to uſe the former liberty any longer, <hi>fearing them which were of the circumciſion</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">ver. 12.</note>, that they would take very ill ſuch liberty as he had uſed.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">ver. 13.</note>; as if they had uſed no ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nor were for it in their judgements. This could not but be a very great ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block to the converted Gentiles, and give them occaſion to think, that there was no ſuch Chriſtian liberty as <hi>Paul</hi> had every where preached, touching meates, ſeeing ſo great an Apoſtle as <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo many holy believers of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> by his example, durſt not uſe or owne it, when once any of the believing <hi>Jewes</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> then accounted the Mother-Church, and the pureſt in all the world, did but appeare and take notice of it: ſo, his <hi>withdrawing</hi> and <hi>ſeparating</hi> from the Gentiles, was (ſo farre as ſo great an exemple could prevaile) a <hi>oompelling, of the Gentiles, to live as do the Jewes</hi>

                     <p>Indeed, had <hi>Baronius</hi> been at <hi>Pauls</hi> elbow, he would have been a ſtout Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for <hi>Peter,</hi> or rather a blaſphemous diſputer againſt God; and have taught <hi>Paul</hi> more moderation, and better manners towards the <hi>Prince of Apoſtles</hi> (as the Papiſts ignorantly or malitiouſly terme) <hi>Peter.</hi> For that preſumptuous Cardinal, in his <hi>Annals,</hi> defends <hi>Peter,</hi> and maintaineth againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was therein in no fault at all.

                     </p>
                     <p>But, enough, and too much of ſuch Blaſphemy, fit onely for one of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Anti-Chriſt. Our buſineſſe is now with the ſincere Chriſtian, to whom as nature hath given, beſide outward ſenſes to apprehend, a common ſenſe to judge of all objects proper unto it; ſo grace giveth not onely ſpiritual ſenſe to perceive that which is good, but alſo ſpiritual judgment to diſcerne what is more convenient or excellent.

                     <p>Another while the hypocrite is all for <hi>moderation,</hi> below diſcretion; as before, for flying out beyond diſcretion. Before, he was an horſe without reines, now the reines over-lay the horſe; all reines, no horſe. Not that true moderation can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; but, that he mixeth too much of that dull ingredient which he falſly calleth <hi>diſcretion,</hi> with that which he as falſly calleth <hi>moderation:</hi> and for this he is more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than for true zeal it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>As there is a <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>profundity</hi> falſely ſo called, which are of <hi>Satan</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Revel. 2.24.</note>, not of God; ſo there is a <hi>zeale,</hi> and a <hi>moderation,</hi> as they ſpeak, which is neither the one, nor the other. As a man may be too <hi>juſt,</hi> too <hi>wiſe</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.16.</note>; ſo, too <hi>zealous,</hi> too <hi>moderate.</hi> But as natural heate cannot be too much, yet, very little which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, is too much: ſo is it here. True zeale rightly ordered can never flame too high; nor true moderation duely bounding zeale, can ever be too ſtrict. Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but the reſult of diſcretion and judgment, in ordering, not quenching of zeal. But, of zeal without diſcretion, or of diſcretion without zeal, in the matters of God, the leaſt is too much.</p>
                     <p>Such a zealot was <hi>Saul,</hi> where God bids him be all fire, and to ſpare none, there he uſeth <hi>moderation,</hi> and ſpareth the <hi>best of the ſheep and oxen,</hi> under pretence of zeal for Gods ſacrifice<note n="y" place="margin">1 Sam. 15.15</note>. Where he had no warrant to be ſo furious, there he falls foule beyond all moderation and meaſure, as in <hi>ſlaying the Gibeonites, in his zeale to the children of Iſrael and Judah</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 21.2.</note>. The like zeale was that of <hi>Jehu,</hi> who albeit he had commiſſion to deſtroy <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe; yet he had nothing to do to kill thoſe <hi>two and fourty brethren of Ahaziah the King of Judah</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Kin. 10.13, 14.</note>. And on the otherſide, when he deſtroyed <hi>Baal,</hi> as a manifeſtation of <hi>his zeal for the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 16.</note>, yet he was not ſo zealous againſt <hi>Jeroboams calves</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Ver. 29.</note>, as abominable as <hi>Baal.</hi> Here he uſed moderation too much, and zeale too little.</p>
                     <p>There is little to chooſe between a boyling pot unſcummed, and the pot that, for want of heate, hath no ſcumme raiſed: that wants a ſcummer, this, a fire: that wallops as the Sea about <hi>Leviathan;</hi> and this, paves it with ſtone: that indangers, as <hi>Aetna;</hi> this, as a Mountain of ice. Intemperate people, to heate the ſtomach, inflame the liver; and fooliſh Phyſitians, to coole the liver, kill the ſtomach. Such an one is this hypocrite, who to kindle affection, ſets paſſion on fire; and then to moderate the flame, caſteth ſo much water of falſe moderation upon it, as doth quite extinguiſh it. To allay that which is unnatural, he extinguiſheth the kindly ſpark of Chriſtian zeale, both in himſelf and others. Oh! ſaith he, you muſt above all things, take heed you be not too forward, too zealous: too good is ſtark naught: and too much of one thing is good for nothing. The exceſſe is here worſe borne than the defect: for that is a trouble to men; but this, is onely a wrong to God, whoſe cauſe few take to heart; nor can well endure that others ſhould.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Mancihees</hi> denyed juſtice in the God of the Old Teſtament (as they call him) becauſe he is called <hi>Deus Zelaus,</hi> a Zealous God, which they think cannot ſtand with juſtice becauſe it hath in it; too much paſſion; ſo this hypocrite ſometimes condemnes that for raſh zeale, that hath more of fire in it, than he hath in his Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And he thinketh he ſhould do wrong to diſcover more heate for God. He will be of a pleaſing temper, fleſh and no fleſh, fiſh and no fiſh, neither one or the other further than to pleaſe men, but eſpecially himſelf: neither a ſound Proteſtant, nor a ſtrict Papiſt. If he think fit to be good himſelf, yet he will not be too buſie in finding fault with others that are wicked. And this temper he likes beſt in others, as a laſcivious husband that extolls the patience and wiſdome of his wife, that can ſee and ſay nothing.</p>
                     <p>This mans zeale is a zeale againſt zeale; <hi>I cannot,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>abide this preciſeneſs, this over-doing,</hi> (for ſo he accounts of all that exceed his luke-warme temper;) <hi>'twas never good world, ſince ſo much ſtrictneſſe was in faſhion, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo he is more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt zeale in others, than againſt his own luke-warmeneſſe. And indeed this diſtemper is grown epidemical; men can hardly abide any other in others: which is a great advantage to Anti-Chriſt to grow upon the Church, when men
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:63232:258"/> want <hi>love</hi> to <hi>the truth</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10.</note>, and <hi>are not valiant for it</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Jer. 9.3.</note>. No times ſo much favour him and promote his cauſe, as thoſe wherein not onely piety, juſtice, and honeſty, but even zeale it ſelfe is in reproach. Then, many who formerly never minded or cared for any Religion, in any ſerious way<note n="f" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.19.</note>, turne Papiſts, as Pirates turne Turks; to whoſe wickedneſſe nothing could be added, but this ſinne of Apoſtacy: and ſo they are better loſt than found.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite takes himſelf to be wiſer than all the zealots in the world. <hi>Zeale</hi> ſaith he, is a fiery metled horſe, and muſt have a ſtrong bit and curb. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders not that <hi>fleſh</hi> is a dull horſe, and needs more the ſpurre. To be over zealous, ſaith he, breedes nothing but reproach and perſecution to the zealot. But woe be to him who, for well-doing, gives not occaſion to wicked men to reproach him, but will comply ſo farre, as to have every bodies good word, and <hi>all men to ſpeak well of him</hi>

                     <p>True zeale mindeth the cauſe; and, according to the importance of that, riſeth, or falleth, as the tide, which followeth the courſe of the Moon. It is not all on fire for leſſer matters, as it would, for greater. It is fervent, as the cauſe requireth, it is governed by true prudence or diſcretion, and proceeds with caution. A wiſe Chriſtian is deſcribed by <hi>the meekneſſe of wiſdome</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Jam. 3.13.</note>. In him, as in <hi>Moſes</hi> meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and zeale meet;<note n="l" place="margin">Num. 12.3.

He uſeth zeale as a skilfull rider doth his horſe, making uſe of the mettle of his horſe, ſutable to the uſe he hath of him. His zeale is duely tempered; and ſo, is a good horſe well mann'd.</p>
                     <p>He conſidereth that zeale without diſcretion, is a ſhip without ballaſt, or over-ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Sailes, which in a ſtorme may endanger all that are aboard her; therefore diſcretion ſo manageth zeale, as to proportion the Sailes to the burden, and keepeth, the veſſel upright. Diſcretion is a male-vertue; but, of which it may be ſaid, as God, of <hi>Adam, it is not good that the man ſhould be alone: I will make him an helpe meet for him</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 2.18.</note>. No <hi>help</hi> meet for <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Eve;</hi> no match for <hi>diſcretion,</hi> but <hi>zeale.</hi> A bleſſed marriage, and fruitful of all ſorts of vertue, when the <hi>head</hi> takes the <hi>heart</hi> to wife, when diſcretion and fervent affection are wedded together. His diſcretion qualifies his affection, and his affection warms his diſcretion, and quickens it to action.</p>
                     <p>But if theſe be divided, they never do well. For zeale without diſcretion is paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and precipitate; and, diſcretion without zeale, is dull and reſtief.

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 3.15.</note>, is moſt pernicious. If therefore he finde an abatement of due heate, he remembreth that receit given by his Lord, <hi>Be zealous and repent</hi>

                     <p>Zeale is both Chriſts garment, and livery. He weareth it himſelf<note n="q" place="margin">Joh 2.17.</note>, and would have his ſervants known by it. And he that weareth it, muſt not onely go in Chriſts errand, but mend his pace; not onely do his work, but do it with all his might. He will take <hi>the first love</hi> of the <hi>Angel of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> for his patterne, not that which was in its declination. He cannot forget that God remembreth him with his firſt, that is, his chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt love, therefore he will proſecute God with love, <hi>as ſtrong as death, the coales whereof are coales of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame</hi>

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63232:258"/> heroick actions. If he be as <hi>meek</hi> as <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet he can, for a need, <hi>break the Tables in pieces</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 32.19.</note>, to ſhew how unworthy the people were of them. If he be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> yet he can [when juſt cauſe is] <hi>execute judgment</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 106.30.</note>. Thus <hi>Elijah,</hi> although a Prophet, made a ſlaughter of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi>

Yea, and Chriſt himſelfe, the Lamb of God, took up Armes [ſuch as holy anger miniſtred] to drive out of Gods houſe thoſe that defiled it. In none of which, diſcretion or advicement was wanting: but the cauſe and their calling did concurre with their zeale. It was their calling that gave them their zeale, not their zeale that gave them their calling.</p>
                     <p>And albeit he hath now no need to feare ſuch tranſcendent zeal, ſeeing there is now no ſuch extraordinary calling: yet he knoweth that it well becometh him to endure a kind of paroxiſme of Spirit, when he ſeeth men wholly given to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, or impiety<note n="w" place="margin">Act. 17.22, 13, 9, 10.</note>. Yea, admit there ſhould be ſome errour in his zeale, or in the zeale of others, yet he holds it dangerous to quench it ſuddenly. Cold water in a feavour extinguiſheth the natural heat with the unnatural, he will therefore learne wiſdome from their ſad examples, who by unadviſed refrigeration have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the ſcorching zeale of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> to the cold and deadly poyſon of profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There is more hope in an acute feavour than in an Heretick. He will therefore hold faſt his zeal, and not ſuffer his <hi>diſcretion</hi> as a ſoure husband to give zeal a bill of divorce, for being ſometimes too hot and too loud.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is ever too hot, or too cold; if, over-hot in one thing, he is over-cold in another; neither hot nor cold, but <hi>luke-warme,</hi> which is worſe than either of the former, and leaſt endured by Chriſt<note n="x" place="margin">Rev. 3.16.</note>; the true Chriſtian is <hi>ever fervent in ſpirt, ſerving the Lord</hi>

The zeal of the one, is like the <hi>brookes of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> or a land-flood, alwayes too high, or too low, that either is apt to drowne with over-flowing at one time, or to kill him with thirſt, at another time, that reſorteth to it<note n="z" place="margin">Job 6.16, 17.</note>. The zeal of the other, is like a perennous fountain, to which, repayre when you will, and you ſhall never finde more zeale than may turn to your profit; nor leſſe, than may ſerve for your uſe.</p>

                     <p>This zeale of the hypocrite is but <hi>civility,</hi> or <hi>morality</hi> kindled by nature, as a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of pitch on top of a beacon. As many men profeſſe Religion upon meere civil or moral grounds, and ſo are but civil, not regenerated men: ſo this hypocrites zeale hath no other riſe nor nature, but what nature improved helpes him unto. This makes him zealous againſt falſe dealing, cheating, break of promiſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, lying, &amp;c. and on the contrary, to be very juſt in his dealing, in payment of debts, in accounts and in diſcharge of matters of truſt; not out of conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, becauſe he commands it; but becauſe nature and reaſon do ſufficiently teach it. A good thing in it ſelfe, and tending to the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but not enough for him that doth it, who doing what he doth on humane, not divine grounds, muſt look for his reward from men, and not from God.</p>

And becauſe he muſt approve himſelfe and his zeale unto God, he layes out his zeale chiefly upon things that more ſpecially concerneth God.

He is then a ſharp rebuker of ſinne in underlings, a zealous pleader for obedience to ſuperiours, chiefly where ſuperiours are preſent to witneſſe his zeale for authority: and, whether he have any care of duty himſelf or not, he will be ſure to put on outwardly, this livery cloake of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>His zeale is like an outward fire, more ſeen in the face, than felt in the heart: the fire of authority, makes him high colour'd in the face, but leaves him cold at the heart, unleſſe it happen to be heated with ſome warme preferment.

This is that of which we may well ſay (and bewaile) that hath made zeale odious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtful to divers in great place, who uſe this malapertneſſe of the hypocrite as a <hi>flaming ſword</hi> to keep true zeale out of their quarters. This was the unkindly zeale of the ſeditious in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> calling themſelves <hi>zealous.</hi> Againſt God, they <hi>would have no King but Caeſar</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the zeale of the true Chriſtian is attended with humility and comelineſſe of behaviour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The true Chriſtian is herein as careful to be <hi>clothed with humility</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5</note>, when he is to exerciſe his zeale, as the Prieſts of old, to put on the Prieſts garments, when they ſerved at the Altar. He conſidereth it to be as much his duty to look to the manner, as to the matter of the work he performeth, that he may not be indeed, what <hi>Michal</hi> falſely charged <hi>David</hi> to be, as <hi>one of the vaine fellowes that ſhameleſly uncovereth himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 6.20</note>. Humility, (he knoweth) is as neceſſary to a Chriſtian, as it is proper. It is a plant growing onely in the Chriſtians garden; and, who then ſhould uſe it, if not he? and, when he, but when he is to ſhew zeale for God? which he can hardly do ſo warily and humbly, eſpecially towards ſuperiours, but offence will be taken.</p>
                     <p>This teacheth him to manage all with reſpect to his calling, age, place, ſex, cauſe and opportunity: or rather wiſdome teacheth, and this acts him in his zeale. Young <hi>Elihu,</hi> though he was ſo <hi>full of matter</hi> that he was ready to burſt<note n="a" place="margin">Job 33.18</note>; yet would not ſpeak before his Elders had ſaid what they could<note n="b" place="margin">Verſe 6, 7,</note>. <hi>Abigail</hi> indeed, in a matter of life and death diſcovered the ſhame of her husband<note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.24 25.</note>: but not in an ordinary buſineſſe, much leſſe did ſhe make it her buſineſſe to be ſo buſie with her husband, as bad as he was. Queen <hi>Heſter,</hi> although ſhe made bold to go to the King for the life of her ſelf and people; whereas <hi>if they had been only ſold for bond-men and bond-women ſhe had held her tongue, although the enemy could not have countervailed the Kings damage thereby</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Eſther 7.4</note>.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, the Chriſtian doth not under colour of humility, modeſty, or keeping diſtance, neglect his duty. When God calls him to ſhew zeale, and he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſpeaking to ſuperiours plainly and faithfully, he will do it; yet with as much reſpect as the cauſe will beare. Under the warrant of his calling, he is bold, as <hi>Eliah</hi> with <hi>Ahab,</hi> as <hi>Nathan</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> with <hi>Saul,</hi> as the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with <hi>Herod.</hi> He putteth forth himſelfe, as opportunity is offered, when his zeale may do moſt good, and his words take moſt impreſſion. He will imitate God, that reckoned with <hi>Adam in the coole of the day,</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> now was in a condition to ſee his folly; and, with <hi>Cain,</hi> in coole blood, when he might be moſt capable of reproof: and, ſent <hi>Jehu</hi> the Prophet, to reprove <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> after he had eſcaped with his life out of the battell wherein <hi>Ahab</hi> periſhed<note n="e" place="margin">2 Chron. 19.2.</note>. If he be an inferiour, he adviſeth rather than admoniſheth; advertiſeth rather than reproveth: yet ſo, as he will not be unfaithful to God or man, whatever it coſt him. He neither ruſheth in
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:63232:261"/> upon a duty without conſideration of time, nor waiteth ſo long for an oppurtunity, as to omit the duty, in hope of a better ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like one of theſe gliding or falling ſtarres (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) his zeale carries him above his place, where he fires, and falls: but the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans zeale firſt kindles him on earth, and then carries him up into heaven, as the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot of <hi>Elias</hi>

                     <p>His zeale hath more of bitterneſſe, than of kindly heate in it. He is without all bowels of compaſſion or conſideration of the temptations of others, as if himſelfe were not obnoxious to tentations.

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>. All ſword, and no buckler is to be ſeen in his fight. He had rather kill an enemy, than ſave a Citizen. He is <gap reason="foreign">

If he can ſay, <hi>I am not as other men</hi>

                     <p>If he be not by nature inclined to uncleanneſſe of body, O! how eager is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt offenders in that kinde! Not that it is uncomely to be zealous againſt the ſin; but, it is hypocritical, to waſte his zeale upon the ſinner, becauſe not of the ſame temper with himſelf. If he can hide the ſame ſinne in himſelf, he thinkes he may be, and is the more bitter againſt it in another, that himſelf may be leſſe ſuſpected of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of it. And if he thinks that he hath overcome ſome member of ſenſuality in himſelf, he is apt to account them, who have not gone ſo farre, among the dogs and ſwine of the world. He looks upon himſelf as a <hi>Cherub</hi> ſent of God, to <hi>go through the City, and ſmite,</hi> without <hi>ſpare</hi> or <hi>pity</hi>

As he hath care to keep himſelf, ſo he is compaſſionate towards others. He will <hi>ſave with feare,</hi> rather than ſee men periſh; but yet he had rather uſe lenitives than coraſives.

                     <p>The grief of his own wonds hath taught him to mourn for the ſores of other men, and to touch them with a Ladies hand; and, to ſweeten, not onely counſels, but reproofs. He cannot reprove, or reſtore others, without remorſe in himſelf. For he thinketh firſt, what himſelf is, or hath been, either in this or ſome other way: <hi>are there not with me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſinnes againſt the Lord my God</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">2 Chron. 28.10</note>? He looks upon his nature as a ſeed plot of all wickedneſſe, and he conſiders further what he may fall into by temptation: upon all which accounts, the Chriſtian ſoul ſaith, <hi>hand ignara ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis lapſis ſuccurrere diſco.</hi> The ſad experience of my own folly, makes me more tender of others that are fallen: not to ſuffer them in it, but more tenderly to pull them out of it.</p>
                     <p>He looks what Chriſt (who knew no ſinne) did towards ſinners. He was <hi>angry,</hi> yet <hi>grieved</hi> withal, <hi>at the hardneſs of her art</hi> which he ſaw in the Jewes<note n="o" place="margin">Mark. 3.15.</note>: So he looketh on other mens ſins, not only with hatred of the ſinne, but with grief for the offenders; thereby expreſſing a two fold-love: the one unto God, by being angry with the ſin, the other unto man, being ſorrowful for the ſinner. The former, is the wine; the later, is the oyle which he poureth into the wounds of his brother. Such was the temper of <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man, and the greateſt zealot. In his zeale for God he brake the Tables of teſtimony, and ſlew three thouſand of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the

                     <p>As the breath of a man ſerves him both to coole his broth, when it is too hot, and to warme his fingers, when they be too cold: ſo the Spirit of God inſtructeth the Chriſtian in the exerciſe of his zeale, to work by both love and meekneſſe, where there is any hope of amendment; and, <hi>to have in readineſſe (wrath and ready vengeance) againſt all diſobedience</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Amos 1.11.</note> of ſuch as are apparently incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as <hi>Edom that purſued his brother with the ſword, caſting off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.6.</note>: the true Chriſtian is like that good old man, the father of the Prodigal, that ſeeing his ſonne in a ſad condition, yet returning, <hi>had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him</hi>

He takes that to be the beſt zeale that transformeth Religion into a vaunting ſtraine of tragick eloquence: and, to make the credulous world to think they can do it, becauſe they can ſay it.</p>
                     <p>Even heatheniſh zeale is much in requeſt with this hypocrite, which ſheweth what wit can ſay, not what fleſh and blood can do; and, making rules of hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical phraſes, wherein (as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>) they frame the level to the ſtone, not the ſtone to the level; that is, things unto words, not words unto things. But as it is eaſie to ſet down more in figures, than ever any man was worth, So it is, in words and phraſes, to expreſſe more than any man can practiſe. Such Writers teach their Readers, as this hypocrite doth his Scholar, to know not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but them; and that (no otherwiſe than as they miſ-know themſelves) on their own opinion: not what they do, but what they are able to direct. And ſuch as care not to know, or to better themſelves by a practical knowledge, are better pleaſed to gaze upon ſuch imaginary pictures, and even poetical patternes of perfection, of <hi>Plato's</hi> drawing, than living examples of holineſſe and humility drawing in the yoke of Chriſt<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note>.</p>
                     <p>He loves to ſee other men zealous in actions too, ſo he be not bound to follow. He ſits at home at eaſe, but cuts out work enough to others<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 23.4.</note>, enjoyning them good round tales of <hi>brick,</hi> without <hi>allowing them ſtraw</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 5.9.</note>; appointing them journies long enough; not caring how tedious either the way, or the weather be to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellors. He that onely looketh on, never thinks that another man workes hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: ſo this hypocrite, who troubles not himſelf with practiſe, cares not how ſtrict the rules, nor how paineful the practiſe of piety be made for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Dulce bellum inexpertis.</hi> It is a brave thing to ſee others fight, or to talke of fighting for one that never knew what it is to fight.</p>
                     <p>It is ſtrange to ſee how ſome hypocrites of this kind and ſtamp, eſteeme and admire the ſtrait-lac't Religion of ſome Popiſh Regulars. Any ecſtatical and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent zeal of a ſuperſtitious Anchorite or Hermite, doth wonderfully raviſh them,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:63232:262"/> but never drawes them to <hi>endure hardſhip as the good ſouldiers of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.3.</note>. They mightily commend bookes of <hi>Reſolution,</hi> who never go ſo farre as to <hi>deliberation.</hi> And if they vouchſafe to read better Authours, the onely end of reading is to gather flowers, not food; to read for commendation, not for imitation, unleſſe of the ſtyle. It ſufficeth this hypocrite to have his zeale in his book, where it doth no hurt; not in his heart, where it might do good. He looketh upon ſtrict rules, and thoſe that walk in them, as ſpectators, upon players, whom they commend for their graceful acting, but meane not to enter the ſtage to act a part with them.</p>
                     <p>Strictneſſe is by him better liked in a line, than in a life; in a book, than in a rowſing Sermon; and yet better in a Sermon, than in an example: But it is worſt of all endured in an admonition; ſtill the nearer the worſe; and the better, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off. If it be a whipping Sermon that comes not too near his luſts, he brookes it well enough: but, if you offer to unbutton him, and prepare his back for the laſh, he will not endure it. He is as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that made a ſhift to heare Chriſt pretty patiently, in his parabolical diſcourſes, untill they began to ſmell that his ayme was to reprehend them; Then, a Lawyer preſently ſeeketh to ſilence him, <hi>Maſter in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou reproacheſt us alſo</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Luke 11.45.</note>: as if this were not to be borne.</p>
                     <p>Some there are who account it a diſgrace and affront, for any man to offer them ſalt, as if thereby he accounted them fooles: ſo this hypocrite is offended, if you offer to impart your zeale unto him; to bring your fire to warme him, as if he were a cold. Therefore, as the ſalt muſt ſtand by, and no man muſt offer to carve ſalt at the Table; but, let every one help himſelf, or be without; ſo this hypocrite is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be beholding to no man to offer him zeale, nor will he take it well of any man that thinketh he hath not enough already, who ſo highly commendeth it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to others. If any man think otherwiſe, let him forbeare offering to adde to it, untill this hypocrite (as men that want ſalt uſe to call to their neighbour ſitting by) ſhall think fit to crave the uſe of his fire, or bellowes. Either he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or he is reſolved to have no more; or at leaſt, not to be beholding to you for it.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>what zeale the Christian ſheweth,</hi>

                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mark 9.49.</note>, and his fire in his own chimney, not painted upon the walls. He warmeth himſelf indeed ſometimes by other mens fire, not as a man that ſtands aloof for feare of being too hot, and commends the blaze; but, as he that brings of his own wood to encreaſe the fire, and his own heat by it: or at leaſt he borroweth from that what may cauſe the fire of zeale to flame higher in himſelf. As <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſeeing <hi>the buſh on fire,</hi> ſaid <hi>I will go near now, and ſee this great ſight</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 3.3.</note>, and ſo met with God; ſo the Chriſtian admiring zeale in other men, doth thereby draw nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to, and better his acquaintance with the Lord: not keeping a diſtance from it, as from a wandring fire on the next hill, which he is loth ſhould come too near him.</p>
                     <p>His reading, hearing, and beholding the good examples of others, are unto him as the laying on of fewel to make a bonfire in his heart. For, he puts them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, and layes them in order, by meditation; he kindleth them by prayer; and then, dreſſeth therewithall for himſelf and others, by dayly practiſe. Seldome ſhall you ſee his chimney without ſmoak, his hearth without fire; his heart without flaming zeal.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites zeale is like the uſurers money, abroad in other mens hands, not in his own cheſt: the true Chriſtians zeale is like the Uſurers bonds, never out of his own cuſtody: the fire of the one, is like that of a Beacon afarre off, more ſeen than felt; the fire of the other, is like that of the ſtove or hot-houſe, ſooner felt than ſeen.

                     <p>Even in juſt reproofes given to others, he diſcovereth as much pride as zeale. For he lets fly, as glad of the occaſion to ſee how he can handle the man and the matter: not ſo much to reclayme, as to inſult, or exaſperate. When he heareth of other mens vertues, he is not ſo forward to imitate them, as to detract from them; to envy, not emulate them. His zeal is his envy, and the taking occaſion from their vertue, to pry more narrowly into their deformities: and, the more others commend them for the one, the more zealouſly he paints them out for the other; whereas, if they had nothing in them worthy of commendation, he would never have been ſo zealous to rake in their dunghils.</p>
                     <p>He not onely gazeth in other mens faces to view their open faults, but diveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their conſciences, and goreth bloodily their hearts, and confidently tells you, <hi>I ſee more evil in them than you are aware of.</hi> But he ſeeth not the ſame faults in himſelf, or not as faults deſerving halfe that zeale againſt them. He is as eager as <hi>Jehu</hi> againſt <hi>Baal</hi> and his <hi>Prieſts</hi> becauſe that was <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſinne; but not againſt the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe that was his own ſinne<note n="h" place="margin">2 King. 10.31</note>. He can finde in his heart to be a <hi>Phineas</hi> to <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſbi,</hi> but not to kill the ſame ſinne in himſelf. He hath ſeveral weights to weigh actions by: one to way the faults of others, another, to weigh his own. He caſteth his zeal upon others as Granadoo's, in a ſiege into the houſes and faces of the beſieged: but as to himſelf, all his zeal is but as harmeleſſe firew-orkes, token of triumphs, not intended to hurt any, in times of peace.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject, ſees the fault of the Magiſtrate; the ſervant, of his Maſter; the people, of their Miniſter; the wife, of her husband; and ſo, reciprocally. But no man ſaith (that which God ſo much deſireth to hear) <hi>what have I done</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note>. Other mens faults are put in that end of the wallet which hangs before, in ſight: but mens one, are in the other end, which is caſt behind. Nay, this hypocrite will not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily let his zeal come near home, much leſſe into his conſcience, to make a privy ſearch there. In ſtrangers, and in enemies, ſinne is ſinne: but in friends, in children, in himſelfe, they are but peccadills, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of a Gentleman, that though they be failings, yet may be borne.</p>
                     <p>He is loth to be an enemy to vices in his children, nor can well endure that any man ſhould take notice, much more that he ſhould ſpeak of any thing amiſſe in them. Who ſhall dare to ſay <hi>Adonijah, why haſt thou done ſo</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 King. 1.6.</note>? and ſo he makes God an enemy to his children, and makes his children to be ſcourges and plagues to himſelf. The plague of God hath ever fallen heavy upon cockring parents, whether men or women. Oh friendſhip! Oh fatherhood! to ſpare till God muſt needes fight, not with the rod, but with a Sword! Haply, for ſinnes that are unprotitable, the hypocrite may ſhew ſome zeale againſt his childe:
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:63232:263"/> in ſinnes more immediately tending to Gods diſhonour, he is not ſo zealous. He had rather ſee his children ungodly, or profane, than unthrifty. He had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God ſhould be wronged than himſelf, and Gods honour made bold with, than his purſe.</p>
                     <p>And as touching himſelf, his zeale is leaſt imployed there. He is very forward and zealous to chalk out the way to others; but, no haſt to walk in it himſelfe. He can tell them what they ſhould do; that's enough. Let not them tell him, what he hath to do. No fruit of his zeale or Religion appeareth, but that it makes him more ſupercilious and cenſorious; careful to hearken after other mens behaviours, buſie to ſet abroach new queſtions: but, if you once put him to the point of practiſe, eſpecially in a coſtly ſervice wherein much ſelf-denyal is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he will ſoon, with the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>go away ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                     <p>There it beginneth, thither it returneth, as all Rivers to the Ocean. Fire firſt heats the chimney, before it heats the ſtanders by. And zeale hath not onely an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent motion from it ſelf mothers, but alſo a retrograde, from others to himſelf. He would have others good, but himſelf to be excellent, not for pride, but out of duty. When he heareth of excellent graces in others, he envyeth it, yet emulateth the beſt; and, looking upon himſelf, is aſhamed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When he heareth of other mens ſinnes, he is humbled, but <hi>casteth the firſt ſtone</hi> at himſelf, not onely as lyable to the ſame tentations, but as accountable in part for their tranſgreſſions: therefore he cryeth out with the Prophet, <hi>Woe is me!

                        <note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 6.6</note>. Yet he was none of thoſe dumb, or blinde ones, whom he after reproved<note n="n" place="margin">Ver. 9.10</note>.

                        <note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.21</note>. Chriſt beholdeth the faults of the Churches in the faces of their ſeveral Angels: and who is he that hath not cauſe to accuſe himſelf of the common evils of others, for want of giving inſtruction, example, prayer, counſel, employing of his Authority, or walking wiſely in the uſe of his liberty?</p>
                     <p>The Chriſtian therefore is more ſtrict to himſelfe, than to others: as <hi>Abraham,</hi> that would nothing for himſelf of the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when he deſerved all; but left it free for his companions in Warre, <hi>Aner, Eſchol, and Mamre to take their ſhare in the ſpoiles</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 14.24</note>. He will not abridge himſelf of what he alloweth to his neighbour, that where he is conſtrained to give a ſtop to his neighbour, he may give proof of his impartiality, and that if he be in any thing partial or favourable, it is to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not to himſelf. He alloweth nothing to himſelf, which he doth more freely allow to his neighbour: nor will he reprove that in his neighbour, which he winketh at in himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He is no leſſe willing (upon the ſame account) to be reproved, than forward to reprove. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me,</hi> ſaith he<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 141, 5</note>. If they be ſlack and remiſſe, he will quicken them to ſmite himſelf. Nor is he content onely that ſuperiours ſhould do it, but even inferiours too, if need be. For, in caſe of common duty, he looketh not on them as ſervants, but as brethren, yea, haply as his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in knowledge or in the cauſe. For, with him, it is laid down for a firme concluſion, <hi>Whoever the ſpeaker be, the truth of God is ſuperiour to him that heareth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, he defendeth Gods quarrel with the jeopardy of nature, yea, of life it ſelf: and, in that eaſe, <hi>knowes no man after the fleſh</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16</note>; he looketh to Gods Image

                        <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 15.4</note>; and endeavours to imitate, yea to out go them.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſeeth not his own ſinnes, but in other men, and ſo exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his zeale onely where he ſeeth ſinne: the true Chriſtian ſeeth his own ſinnes both in himſelf and others, and therefore is moſt zealous againſt himſelf and his own ſinnes, which he beholds in ſo many places at once: the zeale of the one is as a burning glaſſe that collecteth the beames of the Sun, and caſteth them forth, to ſet others on fire; but himſelf is not touched with it; the true Chriſtian is as a wall, that heateth by repercuſſion all that ſtand near it, but is moſt hot it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>He that is all in, and for extreames, muſt needs miſſe that which is the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, how uſeful ſoever.

Therefore when called upon in that kind to beſtirre him to reprove and admoniſh others, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what have I to do with other mens conſciences? it is enough for me to look to mine own.</p>
                     <p>But, as reſpect of private profit overthroweth the weale-publick, ſo this appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of zeal will endanger the common good that ought to be ſought for the houſe of God. This is to bury the Lords talent in a napkin; for he that will not employ it abroad, will do nothing but hide it at home; and ſo, that which ſhould be ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad as currant money for the uſe of his Lord, is buryed at home by <hi>the evil and ſlothful ſervant</hi> to his own deſtruction<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 25.25, 26.</note>. He ſeemeth to make ſome conſcience of ſwearing, drinking, miſpending the Sabbath, &amp;c.

                     <p>He conſidereth not Gods ſharp dealing with <hi>Eli,</hi> for his want of ſharpneſſe to his ſonnes; nor, how great that ſinne was in Gods account, even no leſſe than <hi>an honouring of his</hi> lewd <hi>ſonnes above</hi> the living <hi>God</hi> himſelfe<note n="x" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.29</note>. What then ſhall he anſwer unto God, who out of hypocriſie, is content others ſhould live in ſinne, that his own ſhew of ſanctity, compared with their iniquity, may be the more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Such hypocrites there are, who, rather than want glory themſelves, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let others to diſhonour God by ſinne, unpuniſhed, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, to be their foyles, the better to ſet off their counterfeit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Herein he treadeth the foot-ſteps of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who, the more to draw their own knowledge into admiration, <hi>took away the key of knowledge from the people</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Luke 11.52.</note>, and thereby not onely maintained a tyrannical preheminence, but alſo (although to their ſhame) pronounced of the ſame people, that they <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law, were accurſed</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">John 7.49</note>; and all, to maintain their own pride and ambition. In whoſe ſteps the Romiſh Clergy hath ſo exactly walked, that they have even out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and out-done their firſt patternes, in that for many ages, even here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they ſuffered not onely the common people, but even Nobles and Kings to live in ignorance, that themſelves onely might adminiſter the lawes and rule at their pleaſure: and, winked at all the wickedneſſe and abominations of the Gentry, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Princes, till they came to die, or to be caſt into ſome great ſtraites, and then they reckoned with them for altogether: that ſo they may fleece them of their eſtates, at the price of their ſoules, by ſetling great revenues upon the Church (as they called it) making it ſacriledge for any to alienate ſuch ſuperſtitious donations
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:63232:264"/> upon ſuch helliſh foundations; themſelves being indeed the ſacrilegious thieves that robb'd all of eſtates, bodies, and ſouls at once.</p>

                        <hi>the zeal of the true Chriſtian is enlarged to the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

                     <p>It is the nature of fire to multiply <hi>in infinitum,</hi> till he hath reached to all that is combuſtible: and it is the nature of zeal (as of charity) to begin at home; but afterwards to extend it ſelf to the utmoſt bounds ſet by God to that holy fire. And this is true, of every true member of Jeſus Chriſt (as well as of <hi>David</hi> the type<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 69 9</note>, and of Chriſt typified by him) which was exemplified in our Lord and Head, <hi>The zeale of thine houſe hath eaten me up</hi>

                     <p>The true Chriſtian therefore holds himſelf bound, and accordingly endeavoureth to reſtrain whom he can, that he findeth going aſtray; and to do it as he can, by intreaty, if he have no authority, or by admonition, prohibition, correction (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his power) from ſwearing, from frequenting the looſe and leud Theatres, from drunkenneſſe, and all other diſorders and abominations, that he may ſhew his zeal for the houſe of God, and win others unto Chriſt, as Chriſt hath won him: and not fall under that compaſſe of being <hi>againſt him,</hi> for not <hi>being with him</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 12.30</note>, and of being condemned as <hi>a ſcatterer</hi> from him, becauſe he <hi>gathereth not</hi> unto him.</p>
                     <p>His zeale, as it begins not in others, ſo it ends not in it ſelfe, until by returning from others it hath finiſhed the Circle. He is not only good, but on his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience commendeth goodneſſe to others. It is true that every body muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend one. This is the leaſt, but muſt not be the laſt: he that never went about to amend more, may juſtly doubt, he never amended any. It is not to be expected that if he be a private Chriſtian he ſhould carry on this work, ſo far as the Miniſter, or Magiſtrate; but yet, 'tis required that he do what he can in the family, in the Vicinity, in all places where Providence caſteth him, and gives him opportunity to do him ſervice.</p>
                     <p>And this leſſon he endeavours to take out, whether he be Parent, Maſter, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, Childe, Servant, Friend, &amp;c. yea, he takes that leſſon of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 4.19</note>; <hi>to diſpleaſe, men rather than God.</hi> He knoweth that none can be offended with him that would make them ſtreight, but ſuch as love to have crooked ſoules, <hi>whoſe wayes are crooked, and they froward in their paths</hi>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Job 20.5</note>; is true of his zeal, which is one of the pillars of his joy. For, what can be durable in him except ſin, that hath nothing but nature, and fleſh in him? All his joy is but a Caſtle built in the aire of imaginary graces, which vaniſh as a winde, and therefore down comes all his building. The zeal of a man is his delight and his triumph, falſe therefore muſt needs be a fooliſh mirth, <hi>a fire of thornes crackling under a pot</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Eccl. 7.6</note>. It makes a great noiſe for the time, but it is as ſoon gone as come; it is ſuddenly extinguiſhed and conſumed.</p>
                     <p>He hath been over that fire; and though he boiled apace for the time, yet is he raw ſtill. For, not ſudden boiling, but ſoft and leiſurely heating, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes a due concoction. Not every fervour, but that which is mingled with wiſdom and ſtayedneſſe, giveth the true temper to a Chriſtians heart, and to his zeale: where this is wanting, his zeal the hotter it waxeth, the more cold it will leave his heart. Water that was once hot by fire, will be colder than ever before; becauſe the ſpirits that formerly kept it from the extremity of coldneſſe, is by fire boiled out of it: ſo will he that hath no other heat of zeal found in him, but that which ſome ſtrange fire hath raiſed him unto. For, as unadviſedneſſe may put out that fire, which it firſt kindled in him. So the with-drawing of that fire leaves his heart as <hi>Nabals, cold as a ſtone,</hi> to die within him as to any life of zeal.</p>
                     <p>He was never ſo hot, but he left windows and doors open enough to cool him to any temper that his corrupt heart and the times ſhould think fit to bring him down unto. He would never ſuffer fire to come near him, but on condition to abate of his heat as many degrees as he pleaſeth. And he that thinks it fit for the time to be luke-warme, if need be, will ſee time alſo to grow key-cold. This hypocrites heart is like the fleſh of the Peacock; that after it is dreſſed and made moſt fit to be eaten, it will grow raw again in a very little time. Such is the temper of this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hypocrite, his zeale that was boiled up to the greateſt degree and higheſt meaſure of boiling, ſoon cooleth and diſſolveth, and he returneth to his natural cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                     <p>It were eaſie to ſhew this in all the particulars mentioned in the former Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this hypocrite. For <hi>ignorant</hi> zeal endeth in hereſie and obſtinacie againſt the truth, and ſometimes in blaſphemy againſt God. Zeal without <hi>judgement</hi> plungeth men into groſſe abſurdities, and fearful inconveniences; and ſo, forfeiteth the whole for want of wiſdom and choice in the particulars. Zeal without diſcretion, is made ridiculous, and ſoon laugh't out of countenance, and ſuch Zealots are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made aſhamed of all forwardneſſe. Zeale, if it have too much <hi>diſcretion</hi> or <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> falſely ſo called, degenerateth firſt into luke-warmneſſe, and remiſſeneſſe in duty; and after, into open prophaneneſſe. The natural zeal hath a natural decay, a ſickneſſe, a death. Nature may be patcht up for a while; but it will fail, die away, and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>morally</hi> zealous regarding only points of civil honeſty and humane ſociety, is many times by the judgement of God given up to fail moſt ſhamefully in that which he made his higheſt glory, <hi>Politick</hi> zeal groweth out of date with the change of times, and is but Atheiſm varniſht over with the colour and tincture of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Superſtitious</hi> zeal is like hemlock that makes him run mad that eateth it, and endeth in deſparation. <hi>Rude and unmannerly</hi> zeal, endeth either in rebellion, or in baſe Retractation. <hi>Bitter and uncharitable</hi> zeal endeth in hardneſſe of heart; an humour not pleaſing to God, and contrary to all men. Zeal in a <hi>Book</hi> (not in the heart) alters with ſome later, and endeth in ſome looſer Author, as the yearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, changeth with a new Almanack. For <hi>conceited ſtrictneſſe,</hi> without conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſincerity, reſolves into greater looſeneſſe, when the former humour is ſpent, or hath ſpent the mans patience that fooliſhly gave it entertainment. Zeale <hi>for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> or <hi>againſt others</hi> only, ends in ſchiſme, and in the over-running of his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with all manner of weeds. And zeal appropriate to a mans ſelf, without care
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:63232:265"/> to edifie others, endeth in ſpiritual pride and ſelf-love. In all we finde that the zeal that is not of God, for God, and from God, cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true zeale of a Christian is permanent and immortal.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that <hi>is borne again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> muſt needs be immortal in all his graces, and therefore in zeal<note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.23</note>. He loveth not only earneſtly and <hi>fervently</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Ver. 22</note>, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; And as his love is, ſo is his zeal, <hi>He is zealouſly affected in a good thing alwayes</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 4.18</note>. He is <hi>zealouſly affected,</hi> becauſe <hi>in a good thing;</hi> and <hi>always,</hi> becauſe his zeal proceedeth from a good heart. As he ever rejoyceth, ſo he ever loveth, is ever zealous. His joy and love is in the Lord, and his zeal is for the Lord. Sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction in him preventeth putrifaction. His zeal is as ſalt that hath not loſt its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: it doth not only not putrifie it ſelf, but keepeth that which is inclinable to corruption from putrifying. Yea, it is a ſoule to the body of Religion to preſerve it from corrupting: And herein, more than a ſoul, becauſe it maketh the whole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
                     <p>It is as the celeſtial fire in his proper Sphere that cannot be extinguiſhed; and as water in a hot bath that keepeth its heat while the water remains there, (although open to the aire,) as from an internal and perpetual cauſe. He is hot with others, not becauſe others be ſo; but even when others are not ſo: and the more becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not ſo, growing hotter by the oppoſite that doth a coſt it, as fire is more vehement by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of the ambient cold.</p>
                     <p>His zeal is guided by <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſeaſoned with <hi>judgement,</hi> ballaſted with <hi>diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and giving ſailes to <hi>diſcretion</hi> kindled from heaven, obtained by prayer, devoted to God without reſpect of his own intereſt, fenced with humility, ſweetned with charity, rooted in his heart, ſpreading to the good of his brethren. All theſe are everlaſting Cauſes and Preſervatives of true ſanctified zeal. So that we may ſay of zeal, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſaid of the Goſpel, <hi>If it be of man, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it:</hi> and he that aſſaileth it, <hi>fighteth againſt God</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Acts 5.38, 39</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like a ſquib, that hath a flaſh, a crack, and a ſtink: but the Chriſtians zeal is like the fire upon the Altar of Incenſe, ſweet, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: the one blazeth as a Comet of fearful preſage, but of ſhort continuance: the other ſhineth as a ſtarre fixed in the firmament of holineſſe, and is a faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in heaven.</p>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">John 8.15</note>, the greateſt hypocrites then in the world; and, at that time, taking upon them to judge of him as an Impoſtor, for <hi>bearing record of himſelf.</hi> They judged baſely of <hi>the Word made fleſh,</hi> becauſe themſelves judged according to the fleſh. Look what he ſeemed to their carnal apprehenſions, ſuch they judged him to be. They ſee with a carnal eye, and therefore judge carnally. All things beheld in a red glaſſe, appear red; ſo doth Chriſt, not only as man, but as God alſo, look't upon by the hypocrites fleſhly minde, appear <hi>to be altogether ſuch an one as himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 50.21</note>. If any difference be made by the hypocrite, he adjudgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the better of the two. He judgeth Chriſt to the Croſſe, himſelf to the Crown: for he <hi>justifieth himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 16.15</note>, and <hi>condemneth Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 24.20</note>.</p>
                     <p>He meaſureth all by a fleſhly rule, becauſe himſelf is carnal: therefore is an ill, (yet a buſie) Judge of ſpiritual perſons and things, which he <hi>cannot diſcern or know</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14</note>, but by a falſe light. He compareth not <hi>ſpiritual things with ſpiritual</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Ver. 13</note>, but with carnal, and ſo his judgement cannot be ſpiritual. This makes him ſo apt, <hi>to ſpeak evil of the things which he knoweth not;</hi> and, <hi>what he knoweth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a bruit beaſt, he therein corrupteth himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Jude 10</note>. He that abuſeth his judgment in what he knoweth, will never <hi>judge righteous judgement</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">John 7.24</note> in what he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. He will be <hi>partial in himſelf, and a Judge of evil thoughts</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Jam. 2.4</note>; not calling evil thoughts to judgement, but judging according to the evil thoughts within him. Fleſh, that is, corruption, loves to be medling and judging where it ought not, where it cannot judge aright: but therein it is without God, and therefore againſt him. Hence this hypocrite is very buſie in judging of others, very partial in judging himſelf. He is ſo buſie in judging others, that God himſelf eſcapes not his judgment; much leſſe can they expect to be free, who are of Gods party. And he is ſo partial towards himſelf, that even where he ſeemeth ſevere, it is either to excuſe, or ſecretly to commend himſelf; and he will condemn all the world, and God himſelf alſo, rather than himſelf; as will appear in the following characters of this ſeeming <hi>Rhadamanthus.</hi>

                     <p>He will (ſo far as his Commiſſion reacheth) imitate Chriſt in judging. In one ſenſe, <hi>he judgeth no man,</hi> no more did Chriſt<note n="k" place="margin">John 8.15</note>, not as renouncing the Office of a Judge to which <hi>the Father</hi> hath aſſigned him<note n="l" place="margin">John 5.22</note>; but, no man, in a carnal manner, as the Phariſees judged him; ſuch judgment he would not paſſe even upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that judged ſo uniuſtly of him. Or, if the Chriſtian do judge (within his own juriſdiction) he will, ſo near as he can, <hi>judge righteous judgment</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">John 7.24</note>, and not <hi>according to the appearance,</hi> or ſhew at firſt ſight, without due proof, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.2</note>, ſubordinate to the Lord Chief Juſtice Chriſt, had need to judge as Chriſt doth. <hi>He that ruleth over men, in this world, muſt be just</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite will be a Judge, who deſerves rather to ſtand at the barre for his unrighteous judgment: the true Chriſtian paſſeth no judgement, but what he beleeveth holdeth weight in Gods ballance, and for which himſelf is ready to give account at the Tribunal of Chriſt: the one ſets up the greateſt malefactor (the fleſh) to be Judge, which ſhould be judged: the other judgeth that Judge in all his judgement; and will not ſit upon the Bench, where the fleſh ſtands not at the Barre.</p>

So God ſomtimes takes the part of the accuſed againſt the Judge; not as if the accuſed were not guilty of the crime objected, much leſſe as favouring the ſins they are accuſed of, but as eſpying the pride, uncharitableneſſe, and malice of the accuſers: ſo Chriſt took the part of the poor ſinful woman, againſt <hi>Simon the Phariſee</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 7.39 40</note>; not as allowing her ſin, but as condemning his ſupercilious uncharitableneſſe, even when he ſaw the abundance of <hi>her teares,</hi> and her making a towel of <hi>her haire.</hi> Thus, he juſtified the humble Publican againſt the ſelf-juſtifying <hi>Phariſee</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 18.14</note>: yea, <hi>the woman taken in adultery,</hi> repenting of her ſin, fared better in the iſſue, than thoſe Scribes and Phariſees, who inſultingly, brought her to Chriſt,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:63232:269"/> and without all compaſſion, alledged the <hi>Law of Moſes, for ſtoning her to death, that they might accuſe him</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">John 8.4, 5</note>. If he was for ſparing of her, they would then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him for breach of Gods Law: if for <hi>ſtoning</hi> her, they would accuſe him to the Romane Governour for exerciſing <hi>a power of life and death,</hi> when <hi>it was not now lawful for the</hi> Jewes, <hi>to put any man to death</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">John 18.31</note>, becauſe they were now under the juriſdiction of the Romanes who had taken that power from them.

God will not have his own part taken unjuſtly or uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but will reprove the reprovers of ſuch as deſerve reproof, when in reproving, charity and mercy are wanting: as in the caſe of <hi>Job</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> in judging of <hi>Achan,</hi> although the offence was very great, and the puniſhment muſt be ſharp; yet before ſentence, he hath ſo much charity and compaſſion, as to draw <hi>Achan</hi> to confeſſion and repentance, that he who muſt part with his life, might yet not loſe his ſoule. <hi>My ſon, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and confeſſe unto him</hi>

He expreſſeth compaſſion, when he is enforced to be ſevere: not as inſulting, but as grieved that the charge is ſo true, the fact ſo hainous, and the proof ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

                     <p>Thus, all the Religion this hypocrite makes uſe of, or at leaſt all the uſe he makes of Religion, is, to ſee faults in others that he may judge without mercy; <hi>counting himſelf juſt, and deſpiſing others</hi>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 21.12</note>; therefore he looks more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his own houſe and himſelf, and enquireth, <hi>Are there not ſins alſo with me, even with me, againſt the Lord my God</hi>

                     <p>And, if, with Satan, he cannot deny them to feare God, yet he will queſtion, <hi>quo animo,</hi> with what heart they do it? as if all were out of hypocriſie, meerly for the protection, and outward bleſſings afforded to them, which if God withdraw, they will <hi>blaſpheme him to his face</hi>

                     <p>After all which ſharpneſſe, he will profeſſe that notwithſtanding all thoſe faults he ſeeth in Profeſſors, he loveth them never the worſe.

But that which moſt diſproveth and reproveth this hypocrite is this, that when he hath ſaid all he can, and more than he can juſtifie, he feareth himſelf never the more for the ſame, or greater ſins: but, rather favoureth himſelf the more therein, as glad to bring down Gods market in the price and worth of Profeſſors, not unwilling of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in evil, and to ſay, <hi>jam ſumus ergo pares:</hi> now we all are alike. But, as they who reported evil, or received the evil report of the Land of Promiſe, came ſhort of entring thereinto; ſo ſuch as delight to ſpeak, or hear evil of the wayes of God, or of the infirmities of his people, ſhall never have part nor portion with them in the inheritance of the Saints.</p>

He conſidereth God ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth his own, not for ſome ſpecial ſin; but, for their trial, as he did <hi>Job;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of others, for glorifying himſelf in their deliverance<note n="i" place="margin">John 9.3</note>. He knoweth that affliction cannot make a good man evil, and therefore not unhappy in the main.

If poverty be a puniſhment to the wicked, it is an exerciſe of faith, and a meanes of ſalvation to the godly.</p>
                     <p>The feare of God maketh him very tender to thoſe that be in affliction, becauſe either they are godly, or in a way (through Gods mercy ſanctifying his hand) to be ſo. He hopeth God by this meanes openeth their eare to inſtruction, wherein he will not be wanting: and he works more upon them by his compaſſionate hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, than by any other help he can afford them. A little oyle now poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep wound, is more welcome, than money out of his purſe.

                     </p>
                     <p>He deſpiſeth the former; not becauſe he is no better, but that himſelf may ſeem better than he is by taking notice of the defects of the other; who yet in regard of ſincerity, is far better than he. Such an one, who being a good meaning Chriſtian,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:63232:271"/> yet ignorant of many things, and farre ſhort of this hypocrite in ſome outward performances, and diſcreet behaviour, he is glad to have about him, as a foile to his ſeeming perfection, as a proud woman ſometimes entertaineth an hard-favour'd ſervant the better to ſet off her own beauty. But, the latter, as a blemiſh to his reputation, and as day-light to his Starre-light, or Torch-light rather, he cannot abide. Therefore as Players and Maſquers do either chuſe the night, or make a night, that their counterfeit-ſhew may ſeem more glorious; ſo the hypocrite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to converſe with thoſe that are either apparently evil, or come far ſhort of him in apparent goodneſſe; or, one way or other, to diſgrace thoſe that every way go beyond him in goodneſſe, that, in this darkneſſe his own mummery may the better paſſe.</p>
                     <p>It may be (if not too extremely tranſported with envie) he can brook an eminent Chriſtian in a dead book, whoſe eminent works are ſo fully witneſſed unto by all, that he ſhould be accounted an enemie to all goodneſſe that ſhould in the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage him; for he feareth not <hi>rules</hi> half ſo much as <hi>examples,</hi> nor dead Patterns ſo much as living Preſidents. A book can but ſay, and ſo can he: and a dead Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern is rather hung up in a picture for ornament of the houſe, than for imitation of the Houſe keeper. Therefore as the Jewes could brook the memories, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the monuments of the dead Prophets<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 23.29</note>, but not endure the examples and remonſtrances of the living, no, not of Chriſt himſelf (wherein he condemned their hypocriſie<note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 34</note>) nor any that he ſent unto them: ſo is it with this hypocrite, he can applaud the dead, whom to commend is an honour to him that doth it: but he hateth the living, whom not to imitate, is a ſhame.

                     <p>He will not, in down-right termes, diſcommend a good man, whom every body commendeth; but he will do it by a device, which is to ſet a better man by him, and cry him up ſo highly, that there is no naming of the other any more. A great ſecret and myſtery of malice, to diſpraiſe one by preferring another: not that he loveth him whom he preferreth, but becauſe he hateth the other.

                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian ſo commendeth one good man,</hi>

                     <p>He acknowledgeth that as there are <hi>diverſities of gifts</hi> and graces of edification, yet all uſeful<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.8</note>; ſo there are ſeveral meaſures of the graces of adoption com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the living members of Chriſt, which are all to be cheriſhed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 15.4 Eph. 4.16</note>. One man excelleth in the ſtrength of his faith: another that hath a weaker faith may be more humble. One is not ſo well able to maſter his paſſions, yet he may be more affectionate and loving. God hath ſo tempered the members of the body, that where there is a defect in one, it is ſupplied by another, that is made more dextrous and active to carry on the work: ſo hath he diſpenſed his graces, that in the communion of Saints, he that hath leaſt grace is uſeful in the body, and he that hath moſt, hath no more than he needeth, either to be aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, or to combate with his own corruptions. Many times eminent grace meets with ſtrong corruptions that make work enough for all the grace a man hath. But however, there is no cauſe of diſparaging the leaſt grace, becauſe a fruit of the Spirit, which ought to be precious, although but as <hi>a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed,</hi> for who knoweth how great <hi>the tree</hi> may grow, which ariſeth out of that one ſmall grain. Wherefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> will not deſpiſe <hi>Eldad and Medad for prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,</hi> but rather commend and encourage them, wiſhing <hi>all the Lords people</hi> were able to do the like<note n="e" place="margin">Num. 11.29.</note>.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite in diſparaging weak Profeſſors, is like thoſe <hi>wicked men,</hi> who aſſiſting <hi>David</hi> againſt the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> refuſed to allow any ſhare of the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpoiles to his weak and faint ſouldiers that were not able to go up with their fellowes to the fight, but tarried by the carriages<note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam 30.22.</note>: the true Chriſtian is as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in giving <hi>a ſhare to thoſe that tarried by the ſtuffe</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 24</note>, not diſparaging them for, but comforting and encouraging them in their weakneſſe: the one makes the praiſe of him whom he commendeth, to be a cudgel to break his head whom he hath a minde to diſgrace; the other makes the commendation of the ſtrongeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,

                     <p>As he laboureth to make diviſions among the vertuous, ſo he doth among ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. He commendeth thoſe that ſeem to make moſt for his purpoſe, and of which he can make beſt uſe to ſerve his own turne; but never affords a good word to ſuch vertues as are more directly contrary to his way and deſigne. Thus, if he be a looſe or luke-warme Profeſſor, living as an Epicure, or <hi>Laodicean,</hi> he never commendeth, but ſnibbeth zeal, (which is offended at his looſeneſſe) therefore he cries up <hi>diſcretion,</hi> to wit, ſuch as will let him and his ſin alone; or, he magnifieth <hi>charity,</hi> which will cover the multitude of his ſins, judge favourably, and make a good conſtruction of all things. But this is a charity of his own making, without either wiſdom, or purity, without knowledge of God or hatred of evil.</p>
                     <p>If he be proud, he commendeth not <hi>ingenuity,</hi> which neither taketh from others, nor forgetteth, (though haply foregoeth) her own due: but, <hi>humility</hi> forſooth is highly extolled by him, or rather indeed <hi>vility,</hi> which will be a footſtool to his pride. Not that he intends to practiſe humility himſelf, but loves it in others that will give him more than his due, although with robbing themſelves of their own right. And who can believe that he commendeth that in others with good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he moſt of all hateth in himſelf?</p>
                     <p>If he be covetous and deſirous to make a prey of others, he commendeth not <hi>thrift</hi> or ſaving, to them which are likely to hinder his own gaines: that herb he reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his own ſallet; that, is for himſelf, or for his heires, (if he can bring them to it, which is rarely ſeen:) but he applaudeth <hi>liberality</hi> and <hi>magnificence,</hi> which hath many mens good word, (becauſe they fare the better for it,) and this mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt: but, he meaneth <hi>riot,</hi> becauſe hereby he hopeth the Prodigal will the ſooner be his prey: whereas if all were ſo frugal as himſelfe, he muſt look out another trade, or live upon the ſtock, which to him is death.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is not for grace, but rather an enemy to all; yet will ſeem to be for ſome (for his better grace,) but ſo that any intelligent man may finde his greateſt buſineſſe to be, the magnifying of ſome graces, on purpoſe to pull down the price of other that militate more directly againſt his ſpecial luſt, and marcheth more furiouſly againſt his deſign. And yet even therein he diſcovereth his own corruption moſt, whereby he thinks moſt to hide it. For, commonly he that makes it his buſineſſe to judge others proud, ſheweth his own pride, becauſe he never thinks he hath his due from thoſe he ſo cenſureth. And nothing doth more bewray a covetous man, than to count all men covetous by whom he can be no gainer. In a word, he that loveth the baſe-minded, is proud, he that haunteth with the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to feed him with money, is covetous: he that calleth for nothing but charity, is afraid of a juſt cenſure. And ſo he would ſet zeal and charity, frugality and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, humility and ingenuity, together by the eares, in hope thereof to eſcape from them, all, the while they are in the ſcuffle.</p>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite commendeth ſome graces, (or rather imaginary ones of his own fancie) to diſgrace other; the true Chriſtian commends all, to make them more lovely.

                     <p>Out of the ſuperfluity of his pretended charity, none can be ſo bad, but he will excuſe them, or at leaſt hope well of them.

No wickedneſſe can make him fall out with any, or ſhun their company. But if there muſt needs be a diviſion, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth part with the worſt, in his opinion and words at leaſt, (which ſhewes his heart) rather than with the beſt: not out of true charity to them, but partiality to himſelf.

                     <p>Yea, this hypocrite judgeth moſt favourablie of the moſt wicked, and notorious
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:63232:273"/> offendors. Although he ſeem a great Zealot, and perhaps (which is ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible) ſcornes a bribe, yet at the ſolicitation of a great man, a wiſe, &amp;c. will take part againſt the Law, with a wicked wretch, and ſtudies evaſions for him to delude, and eſcape the Law, in a cunning way: and taxeth thoſe for unmerciful and cruel, who are not of his minde, but puniſh the offendor. But no ſuppoſed infirmity in a childe of God ſhall eſcape this mans cenſure, (eſpecially if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand made againſt him by ſome great one, whom he would, and perhaps muſt gratifie.) Yet he can excuſe, and ſwallow any thing in a wicked man; and ſtill hath ſomething to plead for him. If it be objected, He is a Papiſt? It is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he is a good ſubject. If, profane; yet he goeth to Church. If, drunken; 'tis but by occaſion of company: if, proud, unclean, riotous, &amp;c. you muſt bear a little with the humours of a Gentleman. Any thing may be tolerated, ſave what he pleaſeth to call indiſcreet zeal; that, is unpardonable. He flattereth a wicked man living, if rich and great: and magnifies him when dead, although he died without one teſtimony of a ſound repentance and converſion. And no marvel; for all wicked men, (and ſo, hypocrites) are partial one to another, to make the way to heaven wide enough for themſelves.</p>

                     <p>Such is the faſhion of this hypocrite, and the Reformation which he laboureth, that his great work is to ſet ſin upon the ſtage, and there to whip it with a fox taile. And this is the guiſe now a dayes of thoſe, who being firſt the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters, become afterwards the great Reprovers of the world; making themſelves the greateſt fooles, by ſtriving to ſhew wit in deriding the folly of others, treating ſin in the language of the ſtage. This is all their wiſdome, to become fools in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſport for others that cannot keep fooles of their own. But ſad are the times wherein this wickedneſſe is in faſhion; it argues a wretched diſpoſition in the hearts of men, when no reproof of ſin, but what is done in jeſt, can be endured. And whereas this is defended, under pretence of laughing ſin out of countenance, this hypocrite cannot but perceive, that, this while, none laugh ſo heartily as the devil and ſin. For, as Jeſters are glad to be laugh't at, becauſe it is their meanes of living; ſo ſin and Satan never take thoſe taunts in ill part, becauſe their party is maintained by them.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the Chriſtian is ſerious in this great buſineſſe of God,</hi>

                     <p>He conſidereth not what will pleaſe others, but what will pleaſe the Lord. If God be angry at ſin, he will not make it his mirth; for this were a contempt of God. If he be a Magiſtrate, his very language ſhall make all to tremble at ſin, rather than glad to hear a piece of wit. In this, he is like unto <hi>Job, If I laughed on them, they beleeved it not,</hi> ſaid he<note n="i" place="margin">Job 29.24</note>. That is, if he expreſſed any levity in adminiſtring ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as if he meant to make ſport, the people gave no heed nor credit to it at all. And if the offendor, to ſhew the height of his ſpirit, and contempt of juſtice in ſleighting of puniſhment; and, with <hi>Agag,</hi> come pleaſantly forth to execution as to a dance, yet the Chriſtian, as <hi>Samuel, will hew him in pieces before the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam 15.33</note>. He <hi>will cauſe the wheel to paſſe upon the wicked</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 20.26</note>; and <hi>ſitting down upon the throne of Juſtice, chaſeth away iniquity with his eyes</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Ver. 8</note>. The Chriſtian will not retain, nor entertain ſin in the nature of a Jeſter, but make a ſlaine ſacrifice of it unto the Lord.</p>
                     <p>If he be a Parent, he conſidereth that if the childe be laugh't at for doing ſome evil prank, the childe will do it again with the more boldneſſe; and therefore he ſeriouſly and ſharply reproveth, and, (if need be) correcteth him for it. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe is too malipert to be dallied with: and, he that ſporteth with it, cauſeth it to abound. It is like ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> that, not a looſe <hi>Lentulus</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Plutarch in Cicero.</note>, (who made ſport of his faults, when queſtioned for them,) but a ſober <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was able to bring under bondage.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite, in reproving ſin, countenanceth it; and, in puniſhing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth it: the true Chriſtian, in reproving ſin, makes it flie to corners; and ſo puniſheth it, that it dares appear no more: the one reproves it in jeſt, and retaines it in earneſt; the other handleth it ſo, as to make all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have any more to do with it in earneſt or jeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite ſometimes judgeth hardly of himſelf, that he may blame others the <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Character </seg>13</label> more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How he judgeth others, we have ſeen. We are now to obſerve how he judgeth himſelf. He never judged others, but to make advantage to himſelf; that his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to them, might make them ſeem worſe than himſelf: and his remiſſeneſſe to them, might prevent the condemning of himſelf. So here, in judging himſelf, he is either too ſevere, or too favourable; and, he deceiveth in both. To judge too ſeverely is, for the moſt part, the weakneſſe of a childe of God, God, who being on a good ground, cannot, he thinketh, go too farre in abaſing himſelfe on
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:63232:274"/> Gods behalf. But, the hypocrite will do as much on another foundation, that is, in favour of himſelf, and for the more ſharp judging of others. His chief aim is to flatter himſelf in evil: and, one way to do it, is, by admitting a ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of himſelf, that he may lay the more load upon others, by whom he is, as he thinks, cauſleſſely or too cruelly, brought into ſuch a condition of miſery, and ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Thus, he will perhaps judge himſelf damned and caſt out of Gods ſight and protection, as <hi>Cain</hi> that cried out of his <hi>puniſhment, as greater than he can bear</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 4.13</note>; becauſe excommunicated from Gods Preſence, made a vagabond upon the earth, and expoſed to the rage and cruelty of every hand. All this, is but to intimate that God was a cruel Judge ſo to puniſh him. Not the ſin, but the puniſhment troubled his conſcience; not the fault he had committed in not ſparing his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the little or no favour that God ſhewed unto him: yet was he bound to ſpare his brother: but ſo was not God, to ſpare him. His exception was not againſt his own iniquity, but againſt Gods ſeverity. He never looked much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horridneſſe of the murder, even after he had received doom: for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell <hi>to building of Cities</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 16, 17</note>.</p>
                     <p>And ſo will this hypocrite do, in the caſe of ſin. For, if he confeſſe his ſins to be great, when he can no longer deny them, as <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf did, (whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh was ſo great, that he not only confeſſed his ſin, but (as covetous as he was) threw the money at the feet of the Prieſts, and went and hang'd himſelf; yet he will be ready to ſay, that God appointed him thereunto; it was his deſtiny, his hard luck that made him to ſteal an horſe, or kill a man; and that if others had not better fortune, they might have done it as well as he. This is the blaſphemy not only of ignorant wretches, but even of this hypocrite, when hard put to it, and that he ſeeth whereto he muſt. Or, at leaſt he thinketh God did him not right, in that he kept him not from theſe outrages, but gave way and leave to Satan and evil counſel to overthrow him; not giving him ſtrength ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus, as he fooliſhly and impiouſly chargeth God to be the Authour of his ſin, and chargeth Providence with his wickedneſſe: ſo he ſerveth others, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 3.12, 13</note> after he had ſinned, laid the blame on his wife; and ſhe, upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: and in the cloſe, both caſt it upon God, as if God had been in fault to give <hi>Adam</hi> ſuch a wife, and put ſo much ſubtilty into the Serpent. And ſo, as malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors condemned, do oftner finde fault with the Law, the Judge, the Jury, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, the Hangman than with themſelves; or, if with themſelves, it is yet ſo, as the blame may light upon others that gave them ill education, or ill counſel, &amp;c. ſo doth this hypocrite never charge himſelf with an ounce of evil, but he chargeth others with a pound.</p>

                     <p>Others may be faulty, and many times are the occaſions, ſolicitors, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of him to ſin: but he knows the fault of ſinning was only his own.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite whips himſelf, to cut anothers throat, confeſſeth himſelf guilty, that he may make another unpardonable; the true Chriſtian condemneth himſelf, and acquits others, that the ſhame and puniſhment may light only where it is due: the one <hi>chargeth God fooliſhly</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the former he made bold with God; here, he abuſeth man. He blameth himſelf, not as ſenſible of his ſin, but that others may commend him: and, as it were, ſtrippeth himſelf of his rags, that others may cloath him with better apparel. It is uſual with him (who deſerves bad enough) ſo to diſable himſelf, and to ſpeak ſo vilely and untruly of himſelf, that ſuch as heare him (not knowing his inſide,) cannot for ſhame, but ſay, Sir, you do your ſelf wrong: you know not your own worth, &amp;c. This is that he looks for. And rather than faile of this, he will call them in for witneſſe; you know (ſaith he) that I have no skill, no wit, no parts, no wealth. Such ſhooing-hornes he uſeth to draw on other mens commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>But of all wayes of begging, this is the baſeſt: and therefore moſt uſual among baſe mindes; and, none more baſe than the hypocrite. He anſwered ſuch a man well, that hearing him ſo much to diſcommend himſelf, ſaid, Brother, Are you not aſhamed ſo palpably to ſeek to be commended? But he is aſhamed of nothing but what he ſhould; and therefore, will loſe nothing that may commend himſelf how ſhamefully ſoever gotten. Either he will draw you to do it, or he will, in plainer termes, do it himſelf<note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.12</note>.</p>
                     <p>You cannot do him a worſe diſpleaſure, than when he ſo abaſeth himſelf, to leave him un-anſwered and un-oppoſed: unleſſe it be only one way, and that is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what he ſaith of himſelf. If any man but ſeem to do this, it is enough for a quarrel, or at leaſt for an everlaſting heart-burning. Then ye ſhall ſee him turne on the other ſide, and defend his reputation, with an <hi>Epanorthoſis,</hi> or correction of himſelf; and let you know that though he made bold with himſelf for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet, if you have not the wit to underſtand his meaning, or ſo much flattery, as to oppoſe him in his ſelf-accuſations, but ſo little charity, as to beleeve him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he meanes not to give you or others that liberty, which he now findes you take.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Christian will rather forbear diſcommending himſelfe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>even when there is cauſe, that he might not draw on others to commend him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath too much experience of complaining of his defects, and bewailing his infirmities to ſome men, that rather vex him by praiſing, than help him by counſel, He meeteth with too many, (and ſome of them friends) who are Phyſicians of no value, and Chyrurgeons not to be truſted, who at all adventure, will lay on a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and never ſearch the ſore. He knoweth that as moſt men uſe the matter, ſuch ſelf-bemoanings are ſelf-praiſings: and that <hi>not he that</hi> (any way) <hi>commendeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is approved; but, whom the Lord commendeth</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.18</note>. Therefore, for the moſt part, he concealeth the cenſuring of himſelf before others; and yet remembreth to be his own impartial Judge in ſecret. And he alſo maketh known his caſe to God, who, he knows, will not flatter him: and, if need be, to ſome wiſe and faithful friend, who will rather help him to do better, than perſwade him he doth well.</p>
                     <p>It is a great wiſdom of a childe of God, to know to whom to impart his judgment
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:63232:275"/> of himſelf; and to lay open his more ſecret imperfections and frailties: and, to be ſure that he be ſuch an one, as can judge, and will not flatter: that is faithful to conceal them from publick notice, and to prevent ſcandal upon his Profeſſion or Religion: that is merciful to think favourably of him in the maine, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him for his infirmities, and to eſteem him at a leſſer rate, becauſe he knowes more by him; and that is wiſe and faithful to direct him how to reforme them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite maketh his ſelf-confeſſions, and ſelf-denials of praiſe, to be but as a Lure to flattery, and a ſtalking-horſe to come nearer to more gain of praiſe; the true Chriſtian will rather conceal all, than purchaſe commendations ſo baſely: the one looks one way and rowes another; the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines all landing of praiſe at his wharfe, which way ſoever he ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But now, he was too ſevere, yet without making himſelf ſmart: here, he is too favourable, without preventing of ſmart. The extremity of right is a degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, why then ſhould he be <hi>juſt over much to himſelf?</hi> He that is afraid to finde, is loth to ſeek. Alas! to ſearch every private corner, to ſweep every hole in his heart, is too painful, too preciſe a courſe. Would you have him do, as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, or as ſome popiſh ignorant diſciples do, to draw blood of himſelf? Should he be like thoſe <hi>pure-ones</hi> that are alwayes whining and complaining of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? that were enough to make one to deſpair, and to do as <hi>Judas</hi> did; for after condemnation cometh execution: And well were it for him, if it were ſo, of the old man within him.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that to him the popiſh doctrine is plauſible, which teacheth men to neglect the judging of themſelves, and neither to beleeve they ſhall go to heaven, nor greatly feare their going to hell: but hope well, and have well: and rather hop about a May-pole to put off melancholy, and nouriſh ignorance of God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the only mother of hearts-eaſe and devotion, than to trouble themſelves in a ſcrupulous ſcrutiny of their own eſtates. In ſtead of caſting away ſin, he caſteth away care; and, with it, himſelf.</p>
                     <p>He is a true Bankrupt, who of all places loves not his Counting-houſe (for upon the Exchange he can put on a face;) of all books, not his Leiger: of all reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not the ballance of the Accounts, that tells him in one word, how much he is worſe than nought. He can make himſelf merry abroad in company that moleſt him not, but loves not to be at home in his own conſcience, which would marre his mirth, by cauſing him to pore too much on Gods debt-book, to ſee how much he ſtands charged there.</p>
                     <p>He cannot abide to conſider <hi>what he hath done</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 8.6</note>: but leaſt of all, <hi>what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it.</hi> That's a moſt terrifying queſtion, <hi>What wilt thou do in the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 5.31</note>? His heart would ſoon tell him, (if he would give it the hearing) that as there is no true feare of God before his eyes, ſo it is impoſſible for him <hi>to eſcape the damnation of hell</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 23.33</note>. Therefore, in ſtead of putting ſuch harſh queſtions to himſelf, and entring too far into ſuch ſelf-examinations, <hi>he flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 36.2</note>.</p>
                     <p>We uſe to ſay, if a man love not home, home will not long love him. This the hypocrite will ſoon finde, if he love not, converſe not frequently and intimately with his own conſcience; if he be not <hi>amicus conſcientiae,</hi> and ſo, <hi>amicus curiae,</hi> a friend to his conſcience, and ſo upon good termes with Gods Tribunal, (whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a member and model) conſcience will give him but bad reſt and cold wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come home in the day wherein he muſt needs retire thither, and have comfort ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there, or no where.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the true Chriſtian diſpatcheth the judgment of himſelf as of greateſt importance to his peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knoweth that often and juſt reckonings make long friends: for by account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:63232:275"/> often, the account is ſooner caſt up, and any errour in it more eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and, by labouring to avoid all miſtakes, all after-reckonings are prevented. Therefore he cleareth often, that he may ſee how the ſtate ſtandeth; and, to know the worſt while there is time and meanes to help it: He will rather caſt up his Accounts himſelf, than ſtay till others do it for him, as Bankrupts uſe to do, upon whom the Creditors come, and caſt up his eſtate for him, little to his benefit or credit. What hath he? What oweth be? and ſo in the Concluſion, ſweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth that ſhould he omit this enquiry into himſelf, not only Chriſt, but Angels and men, and perhaps his enemies ſhall keep Audit upon him: therefore he will ſpare them that labour, and himſelf that loſſe and ſhame which ſuch an Audit draws after it<note n="g" place="margin">Lam. 3.40 1 Cor. 11.31</note>. When he goeth abroad he findeth much vanity, affliction, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, flattery, that would abuſe him in caſting up his eſtate. Therefore he comes home for a true cenſure and report of himſelf, and for true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This makes him love home, that is, his conſcience, which will not deceive him; and that home loves him again, giving him peace in himſelf, and aſſurance before God<note n="h" place="margin">1 John 3.21</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſtaves off judging of himſelf, in hope the judgement will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, or at leaſt to prevent the tormenting of himſelf before the time: the true Chriſtian haſteneth this judging, that the day of judgment may be to him <hi>the time of refreſhing coming from the Preſence of the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 3.19</note>. The one will not judge himſelf for feare of undoing; the other doth judge himſelf, that he may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite, if he muſt needs judge himſelf, corrupteth the rule by which he ſhould <label type="milestone">

                     <p>As they that, being foule and wrinkled, would think themſelves faire and young, delight to behold themſelves in falſe and flattering glaſſes; ſo doth this hypocrite, who being evil, would needs retain an opinion of himſelf that he is good enough. And it is ſtrange to ſee the folly of ſuch conceitedly-wiſe men, in deſiring to ſee themſelves ſo, as none others do, or will behold them. He loves flattery well, that, not content to be flattered by others, muſt needs become his own flatterer in a thing ſo palpably falſe, that he cannot but look upon it as a groſſe belying of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoever will juſtifie a wicked man, muſt either forſake<note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 28.4</note>, or corrupt the Law; this, the hypocrite doth, that he may judge well of himſelf: He corrupteth the Law, firſt, in others, <hi>ſaying unto the Seers, ſee not; and to the Prophets, propheſie not unto us right things; ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, propheſie deceits: get ye out of the way, turne aſide out of the path: cauſe the Holy One of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa. 30.10, 11</note>. He cannot endure to ſee himſelf in the Mirrour of the <hi>perfect Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Jam. 1.25</note>.

                     <p>And as he corrupteth the Law by making others to corrupt it, as <hi>David ſlew <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah with the ſword of the children of Ammon</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 12 9</note>; ſo he corrupteth the Law in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; underſtanding, and applying it according to his own humour. When God <hi>curſeth him,</hi> he will <hi>bleſſe himſelf, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the ſtubbornneſſe of my heart</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Deut. 19.19</note>. I ſtand not as other ſinners in the Account of God. I honour him more than many others, and do him more ſervice. I have ſuffered much for my Profeſſion. My ſins are not ſo hainous in degree and circumſtances, as other mens. And this he takes up for his Concluſion; I ſhall not periſh, ſay the Preacher what he will.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the true Chriſtian taketh the rule of his judgment as it comes from God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knoweth that God will judge him by his own perfect Law, therefore he judgeth himſelf by that Law, in the ſenſe of the Law-giver, not of his own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:63232:276"/> heart. He takes the Law from the ſenſe of the Judge, not from his own private opinion which he bringeth with him to the Law. He conſidereth that it is a vaine thing for Malefactors to think to teach their Judge a ſenſe of the Law, of their own inventing, who muſt be judged and executed by the Law of the Land. If he have ſo much courage (or fool-hardineſſe rather) to be a <hi>Dueller,</hi> tis ſaith he, the Law of Honour and Armes, to revenge an injury, and to call for ſatisfaction where he hath been affronted and diſhonoured: and that he thinks, is warrant enough for him to challenge, and fight. But this will not ſerve at his trial, he ſhall be judged, condemned, and executed, for killing, by the publick Law of peace, not of Honour and Armes.</p>
                     <p>The Chriſtian therefore ſubmitting himſelfe and conſcience to the Law of God, and to the mind of God in it. He ſuffereth the Miniſter to judge him, as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points him, (<hi>wilt thou judge them, Son of man, wilt thou judge them</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 20.4.</note>)? But how is that? <hi>by cauſing them to know their abominations;</hi> acquainting them truely with their condition, not letting them go away with a good opinion of themſelves, or an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinion of the law. Preſumption of mercy does more hurt than the feare of Juſtice. Corraſives are more ſafe for ſinners, than comforts. Firſt, the rod of correction, and then the bread of conſolation: and ſo he is judged by the Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>Then, he judgeth himſelf by applying the Word unto himſelf. For, as God, in the Miniſtry of the Word, holds forth a Mirrour, ſo the good conſcience taketh heed thereunto, and compareth his wayes there withall. Where the Miniſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the conſcionable hearer beginneth. As when our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>one of you ſhall betray me;</hi> the Diſciples ſeverally began to ask, <hi>Is it I, Lord</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 26 21, 22.</note>. So when the Miniſter of Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>ſome have not the knowledge of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.34</note>. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtia s conſcience asketh, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> or rather confeſſeth, <hi>It is I, Lord.</hi> And ſo he applyeth accuſations and terrors, as well as comforts to his own ſoul, as the caſe requireth.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſaith to the Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>The Devil is in you: What! will ye urge a man to deſpaire?</hi> the true Chriſtian ſaith, <hi>God is in you indeed,</hi> when <hi>the ſecrets of his heart are made manifeſt</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.2.</note> by the faithful opening and applying of the Word. The one will be a <hi>Judge of the Law</hi>

                     <p>That the hypocrite is a great favourer of himſelf, we have ſeen in the general. We are now to come to a cloſer view of him in ſome particulars, to wit, in the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming, commending, excuſing,</hi> and <hi>compairing</hi> of himſelf. We are now taking an eſtimate of him by his <hi>eſteeming</hi> of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am rich, and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that knew not that he was wretched and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Revel. 3.17.</note>. As he that entred all the ſhip and goods at <hi>Athens</hi> into his own account; ſo this hypocrite no ſooner heareth of faith, repentance, humility, or any grace, but he hath it; or at leaſt writes himſelf owner of it. He is every thing that good is, in his own eyes. No man like him. But this preſumption is a Quick-ſand, whereon nothing it built but deſpair and ruine.</p>
                     <p>This high account of himſelf is the worſt of ſinne in him, and miſchief to him. It is the worſt of <hi>ſinne,</hi> becauſe ſpiritual pride makes him drunk with conceit of the beauty and wealth of his ſoule, which muſt needs be more dangerous than pride of his body or outward condition. For a man may be happy in God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding deformity of body, or a mean eſtate in the world: but he cannot but be miſerable in the midſt of the greateſt happineſſe of the world, if his ſoul be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that God loaths it, and ſo poore, that it muſt needs ſtarve and periſh for ever.</p>
                     <p>And this is the depth of <hi>miſery,</hi> that this pride makes him uncapable of attaining and altogether negligent in ſeeking the true riches, becauſe he that ſaith he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:63232:276"/> never ſeekes after more: and, if this hypocrite could <hi>ſeek,</hi> he ſhall never <hi>finde,</hi> in the ſtate he now is, becauſe <hi>God reſiſteth the proud</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">James 4.6.</note>: That's a miſerable eye-ſight that makes him <hi>blinde,</hi> and he knoweth it not; miſerable riches that makes him irrecoverably <hi>poore,</hi> and he feeleth it not, and miſerable cloathing, that makes him <hi>naked,</hi> and he perceiveth it not.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian diſclaimeth the goodneſſe that is in him.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Not that he denyeth it to be in him, but, that it is not of himſelf, if any be there. He thankfully acknowledges the work of God and his grace, but ſets not an higher price upon himſelf, as ſuppoſing it to be more than it is, or to be of his own procuring. Upon this account he ſaith, <hi>I know, that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note>. Nature is too weak to procure it, and too mean an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation (till the houſe be new built) for ſuch an Inhabitant. He that will <hi>not dwell in Temples made with hands</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 7.48.</note>, will not dwell in an houſe marr'd by ſinne, and over-ſpread with the plague of Leproſie; nor put any of his choicer <hi>goods</hi> into ſuch a filthy ſtore-houſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea, that any grace at all is in him, he rather findeth by proof, than boaſteth of by pride. He is rather doubtful of his own judgment touching that which is truly in him, than vainly confident of more than is in him. His judgment is rather imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the enquiry into the truth of his goodneſſe, than in concluding the ſufficiency and perfection of it<note n="z" place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note>.

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 6.3.</note>, and thereby becomes worſe than nothing: the true Chriſtian knowing his wants, thinks meanly of himſelfe, and thereby, of <hi>nothing</hi> becometh <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> the one is as having all things, and yet poſſeſſeth nothing; the other is <hi>as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things</hi>

                     <p>Some good things he doth, and this is all the goodneſſe he hath. He perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome duties, of which others may have benefit; the goodneſſe is rather in the thing done, than in him that doth it: as, due adminiſtration of juſtice, giving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one his due, charity to the poore, &amp;c. Theſe are good acts, although he be evil that doth them. Good acts, in reſpect of men that enjoy the benefit; not in the ſight and account of God, that knoweth with what heart they be done. But he himſelfe eſteemeth highly of them, and of himſelfe for them.</p>
                     <p>And when he once comes to have a conceit of any goodneſſe in him, he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the firſt daſh; and comes with full cry, as the young man, to our Saviour, that bade him <hi>keep the commandments, if he would enter into life; all theſe have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 19.20.</note>? If there were any work more to be done, he was ready for it.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 9 57.</note>: but when he hears of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, coarſe fare, cold lodging, harſh entertaintment, he ſaith no more, but ſlinks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and beſhrewes his own forwardneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the true Christian thinketh the goodneſſe that he hath,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>to be very little.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He acknowledges the leaſt ſcruple of grace to be worth more thanks than he can returne; and to be of greater worth than he can value. But, as to the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in himſelf, as having <hi>already attained</hi> all, <hi>or that he is already perfect,</hi> he looks upon all, as ſo little; that, unleſſe he get more, he thinkes himſelfe undone.

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Phil. 3.11, 12.</note>, and not yet <hi>attained,</hi> that <hi>he forgetteth the things that are behind,</hi> ſo as once to think that they are enough for him, and that he needs no more. He is ſo careful to preſſe forward that he may reach the reſt, that he ſcarce mindeth what he hath already gotten. What he hath is behind him carefully laid up: but what he wanteth, is alwayes in his eye and heart, that he may attain that alſo. Let others boaſt of their gettings, he will
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:63232:277"/> work? If they have enough, that's not enough for him. The more he looks into what he hath, the more need he finds of more.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like a Fool, that brags all day of a penny; the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is as the thriving Merchant, that ſilently thinkes how farre ſhort he is of that which diligence may bring in unto him: the one thinks his mole-hill a mountaine; the other that labours for the mountaine, thinks all that he hath to be but a mole-hill.</p>

                     <p>The good that is in him, he ought to know to be in him, and not to be of him.

                     <p>He is like thoſe who being dangerouſly ſick, diſcerne not their own ſickneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look onely on the urine, but feele not the pulſe.

                        <hi>the true Chriſtian deſireth to ſee and know the worst of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that is an enemy to ſinne, hath a very Jealous and vigilant eye upon all the motions of it, and deſires the beſt intelligence of all the lurkings of it. He ſhould be extreamely troubled that a ſnake ſhould creep into his boſome, yea into his mouth, and he not aware of it. The Chriſtian therefore, being an implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſinne, eſpecially to his own ſinnes, his boſome-traytors, he cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know as much as poſſibly he can of all their lurking holes, and plots upon him. And albeit there be no ſight ſo loathſome to him as the ſight of ſinne; yet no diſcovery can be more acceptable to him than the notice of any luſt or ſin that ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunts him.</p>
                     <p>He ſeeth the evil in himſelf that others diſcerne not, and takes not to himſelf all the good that others aſcribe. When others commend him for humility, diligence, liberality, &amp;c. He complaineth of and ſeriouſly asketh God the forgiveneſſe of his pride, idleneſſe, worldlineſſe, ſecurity, &amp;c. and fearing his own heart would flatter him, he hath recourſe to him that is no flatterer, craving his help herein, and praying to him, ſaith, <hi>ſearch me O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Pſ. 139 23.24</note>. He dares not truſt any but God himſelf to make this ſearch, that ſo he may be ſure to have a full diſcovery of all.</p>
                     <p>He that would mend his houſe, or his garments, looketh but little on what is whole; but his eye is moſt upon the defects and breaches. So the Chriſtian, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mend himſelf and his heart, hath his eye moſt upon the evil which is in him. <hi>I am carnal, ſold under ſinne,</hi> ſaith he<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 7.14.</note>. And, <hi>when I would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſees not that in himſelf, which all men ſee; and ſeeth, that (as he thinks) in himſelf which none elſe can ſee. The true Chriſtian ſeeth more than all the world in the matter of evil, and he cannot ſee what all men ſee in the matter of goodneſſe: the one will ſee nothing that may diſparage him, the other will over-ſee nothing that might undo him.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>He that hath an high <hi>esteeme</hi> of himſelf, thinks he hath wrong, if he be not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> by others: and if they faile, he will, <hi>Thraſonically,</hi> do it himſelfe; yea, he will be his own herauld, even in the ears of God. <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, &amp;c</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Luk. 18.12.</note>. Would he be ſatisfied with commendations for what is good, the matter were leſſe exceptionable; yet more than any wiſe man truly good would hunt after: but this ſerves not his turn. For as in judging of others, vertues muſt have names of vice, that he may finde fault: So, in judging himſelf he borroweth the names of vertues, that he may not find fault.</p>
                     <p>For another to be liberal but a little, is, in this hypocrites account, extream cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; to be but <hi>a little</hi> humble, is extream pride: but, for himſelf to be but <hi>a little</hi> covetous, is great liberality; to be <hi>a little</hi> proud, is exceeding humility. If he be raſh, it is valour: if cowardly, it is diſcretion; if angry and furious, it is his good nature, ſoon hot, and ſoon cool again. If he be a little profane, it is his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, he is no hypocrite. If he be greedy and griping after the world, and <hi>grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the faces of the poor,</hi> it is his frugality and care of his family: if he be cruel, it is
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:63232:278"/> his juſtice and integrity. In a word, he practiſeth the rule which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gave to his <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> to palliate vices with the names of thoſe vertues upon which they do confine.</p>
                     <p>This is common in theſe dayes: and, no marvail; For if ſinne and this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite be all one, how can the man be commended, unleſſe the ſinne be ſome way juſtified? therefore man deviſeth to put reputation upon ſinnes, to juſtifie himſelf living in them. Upon <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi> (the deluge which hath left us at this day ſcarce any dry land, I mean, dry or ſober braines) men put the reputation of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, friendſhip, and what not? and to refuſe the drinking match, or not to pledge the drunken-health, is an abjuring of friendſhip, want of breeding, and ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a quarrel.</p>

                     <p>He doth what good he can, not for commendation, but for goodneſſe ſake, and out of duty. And if any praiſe do light upon him, it is as <hi>Sauls armour,</hi> too heavy for him, be it never ſo light.

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 5.20.</note>; and for <hi>them that juſtifie the wicked for reward,</hi> as all flatterers do.</p>
                     <p>As that noble Patriot was willing to have the publick enemy ſlaine, though the ſword made way through his own body; ſo, the faithful Chriſtian is contented by his own wounds and reproach to have ſinne diſcredited, rather than it ſhould be matter of commendation unto him under any falſe name or ſpecious title whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And where he hath failed and given ſcandal, none ſhall be ſo forward to put him to ſhame as himſelf; imitating herein fallen-<hi>David,</hi> who propoundeth and recordeth himſelf a publick and perpetual pattern to the Church, of ſerious and thorough repentance<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note>. He ſhould never forgive himſelf if he ſhould accept or ſuffer commendations for evil doing, which is the great quarrel of God with the Devil and the world. If any favour be to be ſhewed upon a fall, he reſerveth it for another mans caſe, but will not admit of it in his own.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is more for commendation, than for deſerving it; the true Chriſtian is more for deſert than for praiſe: the one by ſeeking it, exalteth ſinne; the other by declining it, bringeth honour to God.</p>

                     <p>He that is commended for evil, is commended not onely without God, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Such praiſe is Gods diſhonour. It is a diſparaging and deſpiſing of the judgment of God to maintain the credit of that which God deſpiſeth.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 25.27</note>: and he is an enemy to God, that will not ſpare the honour from himſelfe unto God.</p>
                     <p>This hypocrite ſo he may be praiſed for what he hath done, never lookes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance God for enabling him to do it.

It is the firſt point of folly for a man to fall in love with himſelf, and the next is to applaud that which himſelf thinkes ſo well of: but the greateſt folly of all, is to take no notice of him by whom he is what he is. <hi>Jehu</hi> muſt be commended for his zeale, but he never thanketh God for his advancement. The Phariſee commends himſelf for his juſt dealing <hi>in paying tithes of all that he poſſeſſeth,</hi> but he never thanks God for his bounty, in giving him wherewith to pay tithes.

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 115.1</note>: for <hi>his mercy</hi> that enabled him: and, <hi>for his truths ſake</hi> that gives ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to that ability according to promiſe.

                        <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 2.7.</note>. For herein he hath Chriſt for his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, who never prayed to <hi>be glorified,</hi> until he was able to ſay to his Father, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">John 17.1, 4</note>: What he receiveth from good men, he puts to Gods account, not his own: bleſſing God for his grace, not himſelf for deſerving it: and ſo do they alſo who do commend him, <hi>they glorifie God in him</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 1.24</note>.</p>
                     <p>If he receive any commendation from evil men (who are rather convinced than contented) he makes uſe of it to juſtifie God and his grace, not to lift up himſelf: <hi>By the grace of God, I am that I am.</hi> He will take praiſe from any, rather than from ſelf. Nor will he take it from any, but for well-doing only. If vertue and praiſe meet together, he will rather take both, than be without the vertue. He ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vertue as praiſe-worthy, and praiſe no otherwiſe than as the fruit and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of vertue.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like the Cuckoe, alwayes ſinging his own name, chooſing praiſe, rather than vertue; the true Chriſtian is like the Nightingale, alwayes chaunting out the praiſe of God, in variety of notes, and had rather have vertue without praiſe, than praiſe without vertue: the one ſeeketh to be well reported of, even for evil, rather than want commendation; the other had rather be ill report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of for good, than not do it; and, to deſerve praiſe and want it, than to have it without deſert.</p>

                     <p>It is his great care to hide ſin, rather than not to commit it: to hide it from men; for <hi>God is not in all his thoughts</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 10.4</note>, as ſuppoſing that he looketh on when the door is lockt and bolted, and the Curtains drawn. As the Adultereſſe, <hi>eateth and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith I have done no wickedneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Prov. 30.20</note>; ſo this hypocrite, ſo long as he can carry things cloſely and ſubtilly, he will ſtand much upon his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: making a goodly ſhew, as if he fed upon no ſuch meat as ſin; look upon his mouth, and that is ſo clean wiped, that you cannot diſcern the leaſt crumb of wickedneſſe about him, nor the leaſt ground of ſuſpicion. Look upon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, and it is as compt, and comely, as if here the pureſt creature in the world.

                     <p>This he expects ſhould paſſe current for innocency; although ſometimes the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſin makes it more conſpicuous, as <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the drawing of his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, ſeeking to hide his skar in his face, by being pictured with his finger upon the skar, made it to be more obſerved.

He dares not but confeſſe it, even when none elſe dare to call him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and though he had no cauſe to feare man, but could have made afraid a great multitude. He conſidereth that there is a day coming, wherein all men ſhall know all things, though never ſo ſecret, which God himſelf covers not, upon mans repentance, by forgiveneſſe.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite in ſtead of parting with ſin, ſits upon it, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did upon her fathers idols, on purpoſe to keep them with her<note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 31.34</note>: the true Chriſtian, if he have ſecretly ſinned, it is like a broken veine within his body, which he dares not conceal, leſt it coſt him his life: the one thinks to thrive by hiding, and ſo periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; the other knows there is no way to riſe again after a fall, but to make a full diſcovery of what the hypocrite covereth.</p>

                     <p>This is the Apologetical hypocrite that makes uſe of his knowledge of the Word of God, not to avoid ſin, but to defend it. If you charge him with ſome groſſe ſin committed, and he cannot deny it; his anſwer is out of Scripture, <hi>there is no man that ſinneth not</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">1 King. 8.46</note>: and, <hi>in many things we offend all</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Jam. 3.2</note>. <hi>It is my infirmity,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God knoweth my heart, I ſtrive against it:</hi> it may be ſo, when it comes to be known, and he hath the ſhame of it; but, never before. The beſt, ſaith he, have their faults; <hi>David, Peter, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> had all, their great failings, and who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth without?</p>
                     <p>But all this while, he doth not, as they did, give teſtimony of any repentance, but liveth in a courſe and cuſtome of evil ſtill: vouching them for patternes of ſin, as if they had ſinned to be Patrons of evil; but never imitateth them, as patterns of repentance, becauſe he hath not enough of his wickedneſſe. And though this be replied to his anſwer, yet then he rejoyneth; O, but this is but <hi>a little one</hi> (as <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zoar</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 19.20</note>); <hi>and his ſoul cannot live without it.</hi> He is in this point a direct Papiſt; for, all his ſins are <hi>venial,</hi> but peccadillo's, and inconſiderable ſlips, if you will believe him.</p>
                     <p>But, as ſhe is never chaſte that is alwayes fending and proving her chaſtity; nor he good, that is alwayes in purging: ſo this hypocrite by his frequent diſcourſes in the defence of ſome ſins, (although not directly, but in a cunning and oblique way,) or in the extenuation or excuſe of other evils in himſelf or others, bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only his ſecret love to thoſe ſins, but his guiltineſſe of them. No man will plead in the leaſt for what he truly hateth. His pleading argues his love, and his love his guilt: for no man can love ſin, but he is guilty of it. Some of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:63232:279"/> are grown ſo cunning this way, that, rather than not ſhew their wit in patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of ſin, they counterfeit libels againſt themſelves to the end they may write Apologies for themſelves, or rather for thoſe ſinnes which they love too well: that ſo, if they be found guilty, they may (as they hope) not be ſo hardly thought of, or harſhly cenſured, as ſome have been.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>the true Chriſtian is ſo far from defending or extenuating ſin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors and aggravates it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He cannot defend ſin that abhorreth evil. No reigning unmortified luſt ſhall finde favour in his eyes, that is hated in his heart. He loathes that very Religion that maketh ſin leſſe odious, and taketh part with the devil againſt the Word of God. Mincing of ſin is in his account but a dreſſing of it more handſomely, to make it look more like an harlot, that it may entice the more. He will <hi>hide</hi> nothing <hi>in his heart,</hi> unleſſe <hi>the Word of God,</hi> that will be ſure to expel all ſin that is there, and refuſe to give entrance to more. He ever looks upon an Apologizer for ſin, as a Pandor to it: and abhors the bringing of pillowes, where an axe, or halter is fitter.</p>
                     <p>The Law affordeth no Advocates for Malefactors and Traitours againſt the King: no more will the Chriſtian, unto ſin, againſt God. He ſaith to any man pleading for ſin, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> did of <hi>Baal,</hi> when too many pleaded for him, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to put <hi>Gideon</hi> to death for deſtroying his Altar; <hi>Will ye plead for Baal? will ye ſave him?

But there is one common rule and meaſure, the Word of God, by which not only mens perſons and actions, but even their judgements of themſelves ſhall be judged.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he will not, he dares not, be of thoſe who <hi>compare themſelves amongst themſelves,</hi> or <hi>with thoſe that commend themſelves</hi>

                     <p>Yea, his preheminences in theſe things muſt bear out his vices, and make them honourable.

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:63232:280"/> that before this, eſpecially in himſelf; and emproves it to do good, not to ſhew himſelf great: and in himſelf he ſets a far lower value upon it, than he doth upon leſſe in another.</p>
                     <p>As for wit and parts, he prizeth them in others; but, is rather afraid than proud of them (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was of the pregnant wit in his natural ſonne) in himſelf. He findes them baits to tempt others to eſteem him more for theſe things, than for true grace; and, ſnares, to <hi>lift him with pride,</hi> and ſo to endanger him to <hi>fall into the condemnation of the devil</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.6</note>. He is therefore afraid of theſe things as of a young metled horſe which is more apt to throw, than to carry him. He will not ſtand upon his place, but yield to right even when his <hi>ſervant contendeth with him</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Job 31.13</note>. He obſerveth herein the Philoſophers rule, <hi>Cum laudare vis, vide quid praeciperes: Cum praecipere vis, vide quid laudares</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Rhet. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>9</hi>
                        </note>. When thou wilt praiſe a thing, conſider firſt what thou wouldeſt give in command: when thou wouldeſt command a thing, think firſt what thou wouldeſt commend. He will not praiſe that which he dares not command; nor enjoyne that which he would not praiſe. For well he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth that all true praiſe conſiſteth in obeying juſt precepts, and the obeying of juſt precepts is matter of true praiſe. To be rich, noble, ſtrong, fair, witty, is no matter of precept; therefore in and of themſelves, without grace to ſanctifie them, no matter of praiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite would make any thing matter of commendation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in himſelf, without vertue: the true Chriſtian <hi>accounts all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, — and count them but dung that he may win Christ</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Phil. 3.8</note>: The one is ſo mad upon praiſe, that he would rather take it out in things which in his own judgement are not praiſe-worthy in others, than go without it: the other is ſo indifferent, that he is content to go without praiſe for thoſe things in himſelf, which he cannot but commend in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                     <p>He likes not to be laid in the ballance with a ſound-hearted compleat Chriſtian; but, if he can eſpie any, noted or ſuſpected of hypocriſie, he (who knows what it is to halt before a Cripple) will ſoon ſpie out faults enough in his fellow-hypocrite, thereby to prove himſelf the better Chriſtian, when yet there is not a pin to chooſe. <hi>Judas</hi> and the Prieſts were well met, they thought to cozen one another, and ſo were both out-ſhot in their own bowes. <hi>Judas</hi> thought to cozen them of ſo much money, without danger to himſelf, or to Chriſt, who, he knew, was well enough able to keep out of their clutches. The Prieſts thought to cozen <hi>Judas,</hi> when they knew they had now matter againſt him to caſt it in the teeth of his Maſter for keeping ſuch a ſervant about him. Chriſt being apprehended, <hi>Judas</hi> was cozened; for himſelf was ſuddenly apprehended too, by his own conſcience which coſt him his life. And the Prieſts were cozened: for they loſt by the bargain, when once they diſcerned that he was riſen from the dead; the iſſue whereof was their own deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Now, for theſe to compare one with another, would be a more pleaſing task, than to compare with Chriſt whom they crucified, or with the reſt of the Apoſtles that continued faithful: here would be work enough for either, to compare hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite with hypocrite: not which was the better, for there was never a good: but, which was the worſe, both being ſo bad. And indeed the higheſt praiſe an hypocrite can aſpire unto is, to be commended for this, that he is not all out ſo bad as ſome of his fellows.</p>
                     <p>Well therefore ſpake Chriſt to the generation of hypocrites that oppoſed him, <hi>Fill ye up the meaſure of your fathers</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 23.32</note>. They and their fathers (though they could not be ſaid to be well met, becauſe one generation paſſed, before another came; yet) did well agree: only in this they differed; that whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation (as bad as any of the former) comparing themſelves with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, paſſed Judgement for themſelves, and concluded that they would never have done what their fathers did<note n="x" place="margin">Ver. 30</note>; yet, did much worſe, by how much the <hi>killing of the

                     <p>In point of Religion, he thinks himſelf ſafe enough, if he be of his fathers and Grandfathers Religion, although Papiſts. That he may juſtifie any thing, if he do no more, but what his neighbours and thoſe of his own rank do. And thus he thinks he hath abundantly quitted himſelf of blame, when he can make it appear that he hath done no more than others of his Profeſſion and rank have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Indeed this might ſerve, if he <hi>that runneth with a thief</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 50.18</note>, might be judged by his companion, which in the iſſue he will not finde.

If you reprove him for mixt dancing, as inciting to luſt; better do ſo, ſaith he, than ſuch, to be nought in a corner. Such is the logick of ſin, relying on that goodly maxime, <hi>You muſt not finde fault with him, than whom there may be found a worſe.</hi> He thinks it grace enough to be, not all out ſo bad as ſome others.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>He that intendeth by a compariſon, the lifting up of himſelf, will look out ſome that are below him. But the Chriſtian that aimes by a compariſon to quicken himſelf to be, and do better, will be ſure to finde out ſome more eminent that may be a fit copy for him to write after, and a good ſpurre to make him mend his pace.</p>
                     <p>He that will know what an one himſelf is, muſt look upon them who are what he is not. They are beſt examples that ſhew moſt diſparity, and give occaſion of the trueſt judgment. Therefore he looketh not only on <hi>the cloud of Witneſſes,</hi> the holy Patriarchs, but alſo upon the Lord Jeſus, the <hi>Authour and Finiſher,</hi> as well as patterne, <hi>of his faith</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12.1, 2</note>, that he may ſee how farre ſhort he comes, not in <hi>ſuffering</hi> only, but alſo in obedience. He conſidereth that, that man is as had as the worſt, whom nothing but evil can keep from doing worſe. Therefore he contenteth not himſelf that ſome do worſe, but ſtriveth himſelf to be, and do as good as the beſt, and to be better, becauſe others are worſe.</p>
                     <p>He knoweth that all meaſuring is, from the mark, or pin, not from his own ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling although a good Archer: Little can a mans out-ſide (for who can ſee more?) help him to know his own inſide, but with reſpect to the mark. Thereby, he knoweth how much nearer he is come to it than ſome others; or rather than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf heretofore, in the times of his ignorance<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11 Rom. 6.17</note>, or in the beginning of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 13.11</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite abounds in compariſons which are odious, to cheat himſelf, by ſetting others by him which are, in his conceit, worſe: the true Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares himſelf with his betters, to abaſe himſelf by ſeeing how far ſhort he comes of them. The one makes uſe of compariſons as a foile; the other, as a Copy. All that the one aimes at, is to ſhew that he is no worſe than others: but the other, by comparing with others, intends his own bettering.</p>

                        <hi>the true Chriſtian alwayes ſeeth ſomething wherein every one truly good, goeth beyond him.</hi>

                     <p>He cannot be ſo flattered by others, as not to ſee more evil in himſelf than they ſee good. Nor can he be ſo blinded with conceit of his own worth, as not to ſee ſomewhat better in the meaneſt Chriſtian, than he can finde in himſelf. I have not, ſaith he, ſo much patience, ſo much meekneſſe, ſo much humility, ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, temperance, wiſdom, conſtancy, &amp;c. as I ſee in him. He that is thought by others to come farre behinde me, I finde to be farre before me. I may well go to ſchool to him to learn that which I ſhould rather he able to teach him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, as the Table of gold, being to be given to the wiſeſt, was, by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhermen, ſent to <hi>Thales;</hi> by him, to <hi>Bias;</hi> by him, to <hi>Solon;</hi> and, by <hi>Solon,</hi> to <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos:</hi> ſo commendation and preheminence for grace, when it is to be beſtowed upon the beſt Chriſtian, it is poſted from one of them to another, till at length it reſteth upon Chriſt alone.

                        <note n="e" place="margin">Phil 4.13</note>. If he be in any meaſure <hi>made wiſe unto ſalvation</hi> by the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Who is Paul, and who is Apollo?</hi> but <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt by whom he believeth, even as the Lord gave to every man,</hi> to edifie him<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 4</note>. Therefore, to Chriſt all praiſe is moſt due, and he ſhall have it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſets a dim and ſmall light by his own torch, that the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his light may appear the better. The true Chriſtian brings his ſmall candle to the largeſt torch, that he may light it at another mans fire, and receive benefit of both: the one is all for the Admiral-light, to go before others; it is enough to the other, if he follow in the Rere, and receive from others what is wanting of his own.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>If they ſpeak nothing but truth of him, he will not be tried by ſuch a Jury: but, if they will give a verdict for him, he gives judgement accordingly, be the verdict never ſo contrary to clear evidence. What they ſay, is his oracle. And rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what they ſay, than what they think: for it is eaſier to extort their good word, than their good opinion. They may ſooner be ſcared, or bribed to ſpeak, than perſwaded to think, what they ſpeak, becauſe, if they know him, they cannot think as they ſpeak, if they ſpeak for him.</p>
                     <p>And the hypocrite can better abide to be ill thought of, than to be ill ſpoken of: and yet, to be ill ſpoken of, rather than to be ill ſpoken to. Of all words he hateth moſt the word of reproof: and, of all reproofs, the moſt true and juſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he liketh the judgement of them that look aloof off, not of them that come ſo near. And he comes too near, that ſeeth him as he is: for he ſeeth his wrinkles and freckles, which the other ſeeth not.

                     <p>Some <hi>hate,</hi> and therefore ſpeak <hi>evil.</hi> But are they aſhamed when they ſo ſpeak? then, ſaith the Chriſtian, may I be comforted, when I finde them <hi>aſhamed that falſely accuſe my converſation in Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.16</note>. Howſoever, he can make this profit of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,

                     <p>A Chriſtian therefore, obſerving how the living judge the dead, and how the dead ſpeak to the living, without either envy or flattery; he looketh into Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the beſt rule of humane judgement; therein, not one, but many do come from the dead to adviſe the living. And, in the reading of them, a wiſe man may as it were ſtand behind the door, and obſerve what the world will ſay of him, when his back is turned. Thus, he readeth Hiſtories and Tragedies, that he may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Tragedy.

He cannot be deceived in himſelf, that hath his conſcience for a thouſand witneſſes that will not lie; and, if that be not enough, hath the Lord himſelf alſo, for more than ten thouſand. His heart renewed and made vigilant, is better to him, and <hi>telleth him more than ſeven Watchmen that ſit above in an high Tower</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Eccluſ. 37.14</note>. There, he ſetteth up a Conſiſtory for Chriſt, and furniſheth all things requiſite to true judgment. For conſcience is but the Juror that muſt have Law from the chief Judge, and evidence from the memory: but, being well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be ſure to give in a true verdict. Therefore, he uſeth all other helps and opinions of other men, as Commentaries only, to underſtand the Rolls of his own conſcience the better. But, as they that dig in mines muſt bring light from above, ſo he will be careful whence they have their light, that comment on the dark corners of his conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like ſome unhandſom peece that is more curious than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in chooſing out a ſpecial good Looking-glaſſe; but, will be ſure to pitch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that which ſhews her the beſt face: the true Chriſtian chuſeth none, but that which is beſt able, without flattery, to repreſent him as he is. The one adviſeth with conſcience, as <hi>Ahab</hi> with <hi>Micaiah,</hi> to pleaſe others that preſſe it; the other conſulteth it, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did the ſame Prophet<note n="s" place="margin">1 King. 22.8, 9</note>, to ſatisfie himſelf that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it.</p>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 14.16</note>. Chriſtian-liberty is ſuch a <hi>good,</hi> as becomes an <hi>evil</hi> to them that abuſe it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by over, or indiſcreet uſing of it; or, by taking offence at the lawful uſe of ſo great a benefit. Sometimes the ſame hypocrite runs into both extremes. But uſually he begins with the laſt, abridging or denying himſelf the due uſe of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty purchaſed by Chriſt; and, this over-ſtrictneſſe becomes a ſnare unto him: for,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:63232:283"/> ere long, he will finde a neceſſity of tranſgreſſing his own Rule, which when he hath done, he ſoon ſteps over to the other extreme, and now, holdeth all things lawful; yea, even the <hi>uſing of his liberty, as an occaſion to the fleſh</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 6.13</note>.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, he keepeth to one extreme, which commonly is that of exceſſe; and therein ſo farre exceedeth, as if Chriſtianity lay more in taking ſuch liberty, than in doing of duty; yea, holding the uſe of his liberty the greateſt duty, and the moſt diſtinguiſhing character of a true Chriſtian from a legal Profeſſor. He holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf herein ſo free, that he is not accountable either to God or man for his uſe of, or behaviour in things that are in their own nature, or in his apprehenſion, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. As if God allowed his ſervants a <hi>Saturnalian</hi> feaſt<note n="*" place="margin">A Feaſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Decemb.</hi> for five, or ſeven dayes by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Romanes;</hi> in the room whereof, ſome belly-gods keep their <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>
                        </note>; wherein the Maſters were to ſerve, and the ſervants to ſit at Table, in which he will take no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their carriage; but hath diſcharged them upon the account of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>By which means he is as looſe in his way, as prophane men are in theirs, who keep the feaſt of <hi>Christs Nativity</hi> with riot, gaming, cheating, and all manner of heatheniſh behaviour, as if the devil were incarnate, rather than the Son of God: or, as they <hi>who turne the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Jude 4</note>, in the general courſe of their lives, not coming ſhort of very heathens <hi>in laſciviouſneſſe, luſts, exceſſe of wine, revellings, banquetings, and all abominable wickedneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.3</note>. As if Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had paid ſo dear for liberty, meerly to purchaſe a licence to ſinne, to abuſe his creatures, and our ſelves, and to ſet our Lord himſelfe at nought.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps he is for the other extremity, and thinks nothing lawful in point of <hi>meats, drinks, dayes, &amp;c.</hi> to a Chriſtian, that was not ſo to the Jew: or, he lays other reſtraints upon himſelf, which God never laid upon the Jewes themſelves; as, the forbearing of marriage and vowing of ſingle life, the vowing of wilful or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary poverty, the denial of their own underſtanding, reaſon, conſcience, to obey blindly what, not God, but others command, even contrary unto God, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of like nature. Wherein the hypocrite aimes at a greater perfection than others do or can attain; and, to pleaſe God better, than ever he himſelf direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to do: and yet, in all theſe, pleaſeth him leſſe then they who lay no ſuch yokes upon their own necks: and, receive no better entertainment or reward from him, than a <hi>Quis requiſivit? Who hath required theſe things at your hands</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Iſa. 1.12</note>?</p>
                     <p>Not that all are hypocrites who are feareful to uſe their Chriſtian-liberty in meats, and dayes, and other things of like nature: but he is the hypocrite who pretending theſe reſtraints to be laid on him by God, doth yet not obſerve them out of conſcience; but, to gain reputation from men, for his extraordinary ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and denial of himſelf: and to make the obſervation of theſe ſmaller things, a cover and a cloak for his breach of ſuch as are Commandments of God indeed: hoping, that all men will take him to be a very exact Chriſtian that is ſo ſevere to himſelf beyond other men in things of the leaſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the Chriſtian accounteth the true uſe of Christian-liberty, a great part of Chriſtian-duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He knoweth that Chriſt would not take this into the Covenant between God and him, for the purchaſe of it with his blood, but that it was worth the purchaſing: and that, Chriſt having bought it, 'tis all the reaſon in the world his members ſhould enjoy it as a priviledge, and uſe it in their courſe as a duty incumbent, both by way of thankfulneſſe to Chriſt that hath freed them from that unſupportable <hi>yoke,</hi> which formerly lay ſo heavy upon the people of God under the Old Teſtament, that <hi>neither the fathers,</hi> nor their children, <hi>were able to bear it</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 15.10</note>: as alſo, by way of rule, in all their uſe of things now made indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, there is nothing whereof a Chriſtian, in his converſing with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:63232:283"/> (that may perhaps differ from him in judgement, or practice, or in both) about matters of this kinde, is more careful; that he may reach to the true uſe of that liberty, and not exceed it. Nothing is of ſo great worth and weight in Chriſtian converſation, (next to adorning the Goſpel by a holy and devout life) as the wiſe and charitable demeaning of himſelf in the uſe of Chriſtian-liberty, that he neither over-uſe, nor refuſe the liberty allowed him of God: that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give offence, nor take offence without ground. It is a commodity indeed; but, like a venice-glaſſe, eaſily broken; therefore he is very chary and vigilant in the uſing of it. He conſidereth that though grace hath made him free, and <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him unto liberty,</hi> yet the ſame grace hath laid upon him a law of love, and made him a ſervant both to God and man: therefore he will <hi>not uſe his liberty for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the fleſh; but, by love, ſerve</hi> thoſe among whom Providence hath caſt his lot.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is a very jugler that pretends skill to make what uſe he liſt, of any thing he taketh in hand: the true Chriſtian, having found <hi>a price</hi> put into his hand by Chriſt, is careful to emprove it to the beſt advantage of others as well as of himſelf. The one, by liberty, growes lawleſſe, or ſuperſtitious; the other, freely <hi>becometh the ſervant of God</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.16</note>, and <hi>of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Liberty is no liberty with him, unleſſe it be lawleſſe. If liberty, no law; if law, no liberty, ſaith this Libertine. Hereby he becomes a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> becauſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignal,</hi> without yoke. He profeſſeth Chriſt, but under this pretext, he fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, like <hi>the Kings of the earth,</hi> that reſolve to <hi>break the bands</hi> of Chriſt <hi>aſunder, and to caſt away his cords from them</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 2.3</note>. He is willing enough to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to Chriſt for liberty, but he will not take it upon Chriſts termes. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſtian-liberty and lawleſſe Libertiniſme to be the ſame thing. If not, give him this, and away with that: for he is <hi>altogether</hi> for <hi>breaking the yoke,</hi> and <hi>burſting the bonds</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Jer, 5.5</note>.</p>
                     <p>All wicked men are ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> by nature: but this hypocrite is ſuch by Art and nature too. He can plead liberty againſt law and grace too, and freedome againſt obedience. He can <hi>promiſe</hi> and preach <hi>liberty</hi> to others, being ſtill <hi>himſelf the ſervant of corruption</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.19</note>. He talks much of his Chriſt (for his carnal advantage;) but it is of his eaſe, not of his <hi>yoke:</hi> and, of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that giveth <hi>liberty</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17</note>, but not of <hi>the Law of the Spirit</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8.2</note>. He boaſteth that he is under grace; but he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is under the ſhelter, not under the command; under the protection of grace, not under the precept of obedience.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the true Chriſtian looketh upon his liberty as regulated and limited by the Law of liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a <hi>Law;</hi> but, <hi>of liberty</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Jam. 2.12</note>, ſo taking away the rigour. It is a Liberty; but, with Law, to take away looſeneſſe. Law, and Liberty may agree: but liberty and looſeneſſe in a Chriſtian, cannot conſiſt<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 6.1, 2</note>. Liberty takes away rigour from the Law; and Law takes away looſeneſſe from Liberty<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 5.13</note>. He is free, not from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but in, and to obedience<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 119.32</note>; <hi>in</hi> obedience, without feare of the curſe<note n="s" place="margin">Gal 3.10, 11</note>; and, <hi>to</hi> obedience, without the ſhackles of corruption<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 6.22</note>: and both by Chriſt<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 3.13</note>. He is not free from ſervice, but a free ſervant, the Lords freeman, even when a <hi>ſervant</hi> of man: and the <hi>Lords ſervant,</hi> even when under no engagement to, but <hi>free</hi> from man<note n="w" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.22</note>.</p>
                     <p>While clogg'd with corruption, he could not ſo much as go in Gods way; but being enlarged from that bondage, he <hi>runs the way of Gods Commandments;</hi> he doth run, not away from them, nor run <hi>out of the way;</hi> but, in the way, <hi>making straight pathes for his feet</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 12.13</note>. For this end, he beggeth of God <hi>his free Spirit</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 51.12</note>, not to let him looſe, that he may run wilde, but to eſtabliſh him in obedience<note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 40.2</note>. Chriſt bringeth him freedom from the Law; but, he looketh on Chriſt in the Law, and on the Law in Chriſt. On Chriſt, in the Law, unto Juſtification: for ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but rigour in the Law it ſelf, he looketh to Chriſt ſatisfying, and meriting on
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:63232:284"/> his behalf. In like manner, he looketh on the Law in Chriſt, unto ſanctification, that he may learn to abhorre that ſin which crucified his Saviour; and, to <hi>walk as he hath walked</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.6.</note>.</p>
                     <p>He is never without yoke. He was under the yoke of ſinne, and felt it not, though ſo heavy as would have cruſh't him down to the nethermoſt hell, had not Chriſt taken it off. But now, he hath changed that heavy yoke for the eaſie yoke of Chriſt, which is, <hi>willing</hi> obedience<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 110.3.</note>; and, findeth not <hi>the Commandment grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note>, but only corruption that oppoſeth it. He knoweth that where Chriſt giveth life, he giveth Law, even <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life,</hi> to <hi>ſet him free from the Law of ſin and death</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The Law in it ſelfe is like the Common Law of the Land; all right, but no favour. Wherefore he flieth to the Chancery of the Goſpel: not to defend law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Acts, but to get a qualification of mercy in the right of Chriſt. He rejoyceth to be under grace, not only as under ſhelter, but alſo as under command, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the peace of God, not only as a Benefactor, but as a Ruler<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 3.15.</note>. Grace is his <hi>gracious Lord,</hi> yet a Lord. As Princes protect their Frontier Townes, but for themſelves, and to their own ſervice: not lending them aid as Aſſociates, but putting in their own Garriſon, to aſſure them of their ſubjection: ſo Chriſt gives grace to his ſubjects, for their protection, but for his own intereſt and ſervice. The Garriſon which protects them, doth command them, according to the Laws and Orders of him that ſet it in them, to be over them.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite ſeeketh a toleration in ſinning as warranted by Chriſtian-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: the true Chriſtian ſeeketh only a qualification of the Law, that it be not exacted in rigour. The one under colour of liberty throws off the Law; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther emproveth his liberty to obſerve the Law.</p>

                        <hi>This hypocrite frameth a liberty to himſelfe that Chriſt never gave him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He foiſteth into the <hi>magna charta</hi> of a Chriſtian that which Chriſt never granted. Sometimes in the things of God he committeth this forgery. He pretendeth a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty either from the whole Law, as not binding Chriſts ſubjects at all; or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the Law of the Sabbath, enjoined in the fourth Commandment. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially from the ſpiritual obſervance of it: which, becauſe it is ſpiritual, argueth the Law that requireth it to be both moral and eternal: and, with reſpect thereto, the bodily reſt becometh alſo moral.</p>
                     <p>But, ſaith he, God is not ſo ſtrict now adayes: he looks not for ſo much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and attendance. He examineth not whether men heare the Word or not; whether once, or twice: much leſſe <hi>how they heare</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 8.18.</note>; or, whether they adde private duties to the publick exerciſes. He is well enough ſerved, if people can play, and dance, and drink, without fighting and quarrelling. Short grace and long dinner; ſhort ſervice and much ſport, very well become a Chriſtian, as a part of his Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes he maketh bold with that which belongs to man. As the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> that will be free from the Civil Magiſtrate; unleſſe ſome (meaning of themſelves) riſe up by Revelation, as the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when yet <hi>there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> Or, as <hi>Cnipperdolling</hi> at <hi>Munſter, John Matthew, John of Leiden,</hi> and others in <hi>Germany.</hi>

                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note>: not conſidering that in the very ſame place, the ſervant, till <hi>he may be made free</hi> by him that hath power over him, is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to abide in the ſame calling wherein he was called</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">ver. 20.21.</note>. Nor, is the queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Chriſtian that is a <hi>ſervant,</hi> ſhould be ſubject to a believing Maſter; but, to an infidel, not yet acknowledging Chriſt, or his Goſpel.

He knoweth that liberty is a name that is borrowed by every body, to be put upon any thing he hath a mind unto, and is abuſed to licentiouſneſſe, more than ſome other things that are in their own nature evil.

                        <note n="o" place="margin">Epheſ. 6.5, 6, 7, 8</note>. In all things, his <hi>Motto</hi> is, <hi>as free, but, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God</hi>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite makes himſelf free to what he pleaſeth, and then counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, or corrupts the Charter of Chriſt for his warrant; the true Chriſtian, firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeth his Charter, and thence circumſcribeth his freedome; the one is, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, no better than thoſe rogues, who make themſelves paſſes under an hedge, wherein one cunning rogue, playes the Juſtice, or his Clerk, for all the reſt: (for ſo, when vagrant luſts meet in a wicked heart, one helpes another, and hypocriſie playing the Clerk, makes paſſes for them all:) the other is like a vigilant Conſtable, that examining theſe falſe paſſes, whippeth thoſe luſts that produce them, and tears their paſſes in pieces.</p>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite had rather ſing, and ſay, <hi>Carry burdens, or do any thing;</hi> than ſo to hear as to learn, ſo to meditate, as to make conſcience; ſo to be free, as to lay nothing upon himſelf: the true Chriſtian being delivered from that rack of minde, lying on the unſatisfied Chriſtian, and impoſed by the hypocrite upon himſelf, beſtoweth all his care how to perform ſpiritual worſhip with a free ſpirit: the one is for meats and drinks and outward ceremonies; the other is for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the heart with grace, and to be freed what he may from outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that he may be more free and vacant for ſubſtantial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is over-abſtemious: not as not loving of liberty, even to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity; but rather, as angry that he is curbed in the liberty which he loveth, he deſpiſeth Chriſts allowance: not unlike to thoſe children, who becauſe they may not have the whole apple, throw away the half: the true Chriſtian thankfully uſeth liberty, where it is uſeful, although he may not have all that he deſireth; being of the minde, that, better half a loaf, than no bread: the one is like an humorous and froward ſervant, who not pleaſed with his Maſters livery, chooſeth rather to go in rags to diſhonour his Maſter, than to wear what is appointed him; the other is as the <hi>Prodigal ſonne</hi> returned, ſo full of ſelf-denial that he will now be content with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any thing that his father will allow him<note n="w" place="margin">Luke 15.19</note>.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Scandal, or offence is that whereat any one <hi>stumbleth, or daſheth himſelf</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18.6</note>, and is thereby hindred, or weakned in the way, or <hi>turned out of the way</hi> of goodneſſe<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12.13</note>. Such ſcandals have been, are, and muſt be while wicked men continue in the world under the guiſe, habit, and name of Chriſtians and Profeſſors; both for the diſcovery of their hypocriſie<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 2.35</note>, and for the trial of the truely godly<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19</note>. Scandal, in the language of the Holy Ghoſt, imports the ſtumbling of ſome perſon in the Church, at ſome thing, or perſon, within the Church alſo. Therefore the ſin is the greater, by whomſoever committed. Hence our Saviour denounceth, <hi>Wo to the world, becauſe of offences. For,</hi> though <hi>it muſt needs be that offences come;</hi> yet <hi>wo to the man by whom the offence cometh</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 18.7</note>. <hi>It were better for him that a milstone had been hang'd about his neck and that he had been drowned in the midſt of the ſea,</hi> before he had <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven offence and ſcandal to ſo much as one beleever</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Ver. 6</note>.</p>
                     <p>But, let it fare how it will with them that give, or take offence, Satan is more buſie to promote this trade, than any other courſe of ſin, becauſe other ſins are moſt commonly committed by the beaſts and ſwine of the world; but this, by the choiceſt and moſt precious people of the world, at leaſt in name; whereby not only ſome one, or few, ſin; but, many moe are offended and grieved; and the Name of Chriſt, and his Goſpel, exceedingly blaſphemed by the reſt of the world, who are glad of the ſin committed; becauſe, thereby all Profeſſors, the Goſpel, and Chriſt himſelf are all ſhamed at once; or at leaſt, the world will do what they can to have it ſo. With good reaſon therefore doth Chriſt proclaim <hi>wo to the world becauſe of offences;</hi> becauſe, though carnal profeſſed worldlings be not firſt in this ſin, but it is begun and carried on by Profeſſors; yet, it becomes their ſin alſo at the rebound, when once they come to take notice of it. And ſo <hi>ſcandal</hi> comes at length to contract an almoſt univerſal guilt, whereſoever, and by whomſoever it firſt began.</p>
                     <p>He therefore that takes up this ſin, drives on the devils trade, and is therein a devil incarnate, eſpecially if he do it willingly as delighting in it. Every ſin, how ſmall ſoever, is damnable, but every ſin is the more damnable, by how many the more it involves in the guilt of it. And there is no ſin that draws in ſo many at the long-run, as this of ſcandal. Sometimes a Chriſtian may haply fall into it, ere he be aware, as <hi>Peter,</hi> when he perſwaded Chriſt to <hi>ſpare himſelf,</hi> and not to ſuffer the things which he foretold of himſelf: for which purpoſe <hi>Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee, Lord; this ſhall not be unto thee</hi>

                           </gap>
                        </note>; But the good man was ſo far miſtaken, that Chriſt forthwith gave him this ſharp check, <hi>Get thee behinde me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 23</note>. <hi>Peter</hi> was an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto him</hi> as endeavouring to <hi>hinder</hi> him, or <hi>to turne him out of the way</hi> which God had appointed for him: and, thereby acted <hi>Satans</hi> part; and for doing his office, is called <hi>Satan,</hi> by his Lord: for, had <hi>Peter</hi> therein prevailed,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:63232:287"/> all the world, and himſelfe too, had periſhed for ever.</p>
                     <p>But, the hypocrite makes this his trade, he hath a minde to offend others, he loves to vex and grieve them, by caſting blocks in their way; and to take offence and quarrel at almoſt every thing they do. He is never well, but when he is giving, or taking offence. Hence that ſad complaint of God, <hi>Among my people are found wicked men; they lay wait as he that ſetteth ſnares; they ſet a trap, they catch men</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Jer. 5.26</note>. He is never in his element, but when he can cauſe others to fall: and none ſo cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious at others, to take them up for falling before they be down. And, whether they ſtumble at him, or he at them, ſtill the fault is theirs, not his: they take offence at him without cauſe, and give him juſt cauſe to take offence at them. If others take offence at him, for giving offence, his anſwer is, <hi>What have you to do with that, or with me? Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant?</hi> making uſe of the words, contrary to the ſenſe. If he take offence at them: it is excuſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to ſay, <hi>Why lay they blocks in my wayes? why do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me?</hi>

                        <hi>walk in darkneſſe, not knowing whither they go,</hi> to ſtumble, or to run their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a poſt, ere they be aware, becauſe they lack <hi>light.</hi> He that is in the light, and walketh in it, is in no ſuch danger. Or, if he caſually ſtumble, he quickly, by the help of the light, gets up again, as <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others have done.</p>
                     <p>If he happen to ſtumble, and fall, he doth not lay the fault upon others, but takes all upon himſelfe. <hi>David</hi> did not charge his ſin upon <hi>Bathſhebahs</hi> immodeſty, in <hi>waſhing her ſelf</hi> ſo openly, that he could not but ſee her naked <hi>from the roof of his houſe</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 11.2</note>, where it was not unlawful for him to be; but, he chargeth all upon his own ſinful luſt, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13</note>. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he fell, he did not blame the maid for her bold face, that ſo earneſtly ſtared him in the face, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him that he was one of Chriſts company; nor, their confidence who, one after another frighted him by charging him with the ſame thing ſo as was enough to have daunted the beſt courage at ſuch a time, and at ſuch a diſadvantage of place, and power; but, he quietly and humbly takes all upon his own cowardiſe and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. He firſt gave offence to Chriſt in diſſwading him from ſuffering; and now, takes offence at Chriſt, when he ſaw him likely to ſuffer; and both theſe he lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with <hi>bitter teares</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Luke 22.62</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like a common Barretor, that cares not to do any man right; and reſolves to take nothing, which he calls wrong; the true Chriſtian will <hi>give no offence, neither to the Jew, nor to the Gentile, nor to the Church of God</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor 10.32</note>: and, will <hi>rather take wrong</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 6 7</note>, and ſay to them that have given him moſt offence, <hi>ye have not injured me at all</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Gal. 4.12</note>, than quarrel and brabble for every offence offered. The one is ſcandalous and captious, yet layeth all the blame upon others; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is inoffenſive, and charitable, without complaining of others.</p>

                     <p>He offendeth others, both by ſinning againſt God, at which they are <hi>grieved</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 139.21</note>; and by <hi>laying a ſtumbling block before them,</hi> whereby they are ſolicited and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſin, either by cauſing <hi>the Name of God to be blaſphemed among the Gintiles, through him</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Rom. 2.24</note>; that is, by opening the mouthes of ſuch as are openly and athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtically profane, to ſpeak all manner of evil of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and of each member of Chriſt in particular, as if he and they were all alike; or, to be drawn by his example, unto the ſame wickedneſſe with him. And ſo he makes the conſequent of his ſin, through the danger of example, a greater evil than the ſin
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:63232:287"/> it ſelf which he firſt committed, ſimply conſidered in the nature of it, becauſe by conſequent, <hi>ſcandal</hi> given multiplieth both ſin, and ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit, when he hath thus ſinned, and is reproved for it, he roughly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Every veſſel ſhall ſtand on his own bottom: what need any body be offended at me?</hi> He confeſſeth the fact, when 'tis too palpable to be denied; but he denieth it to be <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> if others would not be over-buſie to take offence. He thinks he can make his party good with God, well enough; but, he is loth to be charged with the conſequent, whereby he ſhould be caſt as guilty of drawing other men into ſin alſo, and ſo incur that <hi>wo</hi> denounced by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt againſt ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Do as I ſay, not as I do: follow my Profeſſion, not my practice.</hi> Indeed that were wiſdom; and ſo, one party would be clear: but now, the fault becomes the others that ſtumbleth at his ſtumbling block, which encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth both his guilt, and his condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily,<note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>the true Chriſtian is therefore more careful to abſtain from all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, that he might not put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall, in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers way</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 14.13</note>.</p>
                     <p>He will refrain the uſe of things lawful, and never make uſe of his juſt liberty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him by Chriſt while he liveth, rather than <hi>eat of fleſh, or drink wine, or any thing, whereby his brother might ſtumble, or be offended, or made weak</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Ver. 21</note>: He knows how to value his liberty as well as another; but, he preferreth <hi>charity</hi> before liberty; and his brothers ſafety before his own will. He will <hi>not walk ſo uncharitably</hi> as to <hi>grieve his brother by his meat,</hi> much leſſe to <hi>deſtroy him for whom Chriſt died</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Ver. 15</note>.</p>
                     <p>Much more will he avoid the <hi>giving of offence in any thing</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.3</note>, that is evil, or hath but an <hi>appearance</hi> of it. He is more afraid of being the occaſion of another mans ſinning in the leaſt, than of ſuffering the greateſt trouble himſelf. He will do nothing to make him ſo much as to halt, but carefully <hi>followeth the things wherewith he may edifie others</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 14.19</note>. He will in all things ſo do, as one that <hi>is his brothers Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Gen 4.9</note>. that he <hi>may do no evil;</hi> that <hi>the eare which heareth him, may bleſſe him, and the eye that ſeeth him may give witneſſe to him</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Job 29.11</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite cares not what blocks he layeth in the wayes of others, ſo he may have his will in ſinning; the true Chriſtian careth not how much he deny himſelf, ſo he may thereby be free from giving offence. The one layeth ſnares to <hi>catch men;</hi> the other breaketh all the ſnares he can, that men may not be caught.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This hypocrite ſometimes cauſeth others to lay thoſe blocks in the way, which he will <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>Either there is ſome ſpecial reſtraint laid upon him by God, or men, that he may not, he dare not be ſeen in laying ſtumbling-blocks himſelf, and then he will do it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he may not be ſeen, or thought to have any hand in it. Thus <hi>Balaam,</hi> (who was kept from <hi>curſing Iſrael</hi>) when he ſaw he could do no miſchief to Gods people, by any act of his own; yet, rather than do nothing, <hi>he taught Balaak</hi> to caſt a <hi>ſtumbling-block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to idols, and to commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 2.14</note>

                        <note n="f" place="margin">Num. 25.1, 2</note>. <hi>The daughters of Moab</hi> were ſent out among the Iſraelites as a ſnare, to provoke them to uncleanneſſe: which, the women would not yield unto, till the men firſt went with them <hi>to the ſacrifices of their gods, and bowed down unto them</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Ver. 3</note>. <hi>Balaam</hi> carried this ſo ſmoothly, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> being wounded, never knew who laid the plot to hurt them. But God found him out in his cloſeſt wickedneſſe, and hath ſet the diſcovery thereof upon record, to let all ſuch hypocrites know that they are not hid from him.</p>
                     <p>Or, perhaps, the greatneſſe, or gravity of his place or yeares, or ſome relation, or feare to be branded, or otherwiſe to ſuffer for it, makes him unwilling to be ſeen himſelf to cauſe others to fall; yet he hath his inſtruments fitted for ſuch a work; and them, under-hand, he employeth to do the feat as dextrouſly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, as if he had done it himſelf. <hi>Jezabel</hi> had her <hi>Elders and Noblet</hi> to ſuborne falſe witneſſes, and to ſtone <hi>Naboth</hi> at <hi>a faſt,</hi> while <hi>Ahab</hi> and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,

And, if thereby, the other before whom he cauſed a block to be laid, happen to ſtumble and fall, none ſhall be more readie to inſult over him, and to be more ſharp and bitter againſt him, than this hypocrite who firſt laid the plot.

And, he be ſo enflamed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he who was firſt but occaſionally tempted by her, now tempts her in plain termes, and never gives over, till ſhe yield, and wickedneſſe be committed? Now is ſhe become a temptation and a tempter too, in effect, and ſo makes her ſelf guilty of his wickedneſſe as well as of her own. The like may be ſaid of married perſons, who under colour of extreme love, carry themſelves ſo fondly, and in ſuch an unſeemly, (and ſometimes wanton) manner before others, that they provoke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to luſt; and that ſo far, as it many times ends in the defiling of the woman that behaved her ſelf ſo fooliſhly, as a juſt puniſhment of the husbands fondneſs &amp; folly.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian avoideth all occaſions of tentation,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He is as careful that other men take not hurt by his careleſſe uſing of fire in his own houſe, as he is, not to ſet their houſes on fire, of purpoſe. He will not be ſo regardleſſe of others, as to uſe any part of his liberty before them who are either not ſo perſwaded as he is, or not permitted to do as he doth. He obſerveth that tinder being brought too near the fire, may kindle, without ſtriking fire into it. He thinks it not enough to ſay, I tempt no man, nor woman; I uſe no idle or wanton ſpeech, or behaviour, unleſſe he be able to ſay alſo, I do not that act in the preſence of others, which might occaſion ſinne in others.</p>
                     <p>His liberty is governed by charity; and his love, by modeſty, and ſobriety: and theſe teach him ſo to uſe his liberty as to preſerve holineſſe and honeſty in others as well as in himſelf; to caſt water upon other mens undue fires, not to help them with bellowes. Liberty (he findes) is an expatiating thing, and therefore muſt be bounded: ſo that he, that hath laid Chriſt for the corner-ſtone in his own heart, will be careful by no means to lay a ſtumbling-ſtone before others.

                     <p>He may <hi>do all things</hi> that Chriſt hath made <hi>lawful</hi> unto him; but, <hi>he will not be brought under the power of any thing</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12</note>, ſo as not to be able to abſtain from the uſe of it, where he findes it inexpedient, or hurtful to others in the leaſt. He hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do many things more than he doth; but no power of his ſhall be uſed as a <hi>ſtumbling-block to them that are weak</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.9</note>, nor as bellowes to the wicked. He knows
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:63232:289"/> little difference between ſinning himſelf, and being wittingly an occaſion of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to ſin in others; unleſſe, to be guilty of the ſins of others alſo.

                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is as he that cares not how many houſes, by his occaſion, be in a flame, ſo it cannot be proved that he neither intended or attempted to ſet them on fire: the true Chriſtian is as he that will rather rake up his own fire, or caſt water upon it, than any ſpark of his ſhould catch in his neighbours houſe. The one doth as truly tempt in <hi>effect,</hi> as he that is a <hi>formal</hi> tempter, and then thinks to ſalve all with a diſtinction; the other will not tempt either way, becauſe both are ſinful, and ſo no diſtinction between them will be admitted at the Tribunal of Chriſt; <hi>temptation,</hi> being but as laying the bait, and <hi>tempting,</hi> but as ſetting the net, and hunting into it.</p>

He doth it <hi>haeſitante conſcientiâ,</hi> with a ſtaggering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if not againſt conſcience: and ſo ſinneth, though the thing in it ſelf may poſſibly be lawful, and good. It is lawful to eat all ſorts of meats, ſaith one: not ſo, ſaith another, who thinks he hath ſtrong reaſons to abſtain: yet, upon ſome reaſons (which he accounteth weak) he eateth, and therein ſinneth, as to his own conſcience, though not as to the meat it ſelf. For he <hi>eateth doubtingly;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>is damned if he eat;</hi> not eternally damned by the ſentence of God, yet damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſinner by his own conſcience, <hi>becauſe he eateth not in faith,</hi> as believing that to be lawful which he doth: for, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 14.23</note>.</p>
                     <p>If he love the meat, he will adventure to eat it, although he ſin by it: if he love it not, he will diſpute againſt it, although he be out in it. Yea, ſometimes he hoodwinks himſelf, that he may ſin blindfold. He will not be perſwaded of, nor ſo much as enquire far into the unlawfulneſſe of that which he hath a minde unto: and ſo he can ſwallow thoſe great Camels of breach of the Sabbath, Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, deceitful myſteries in trades, &amp;c. as ſo many gnats that will never (as he thinks) choak his conſcience, nor in the leaſt offend it. What need I, ſaith he, trouble my conſcience about that breach of the Sabbath, which is not puniſhable by Law? And the like Queries he makes touching any diſputable thing to which his heart is enclined: and, love to ſin will make any thing diſputable to ſuch an heart.</p>
                     <p>If but the title of a book propound a lawful uſe of lots, recreations, intereſt, &amp;c. he will not trouble himſelf to enquire, in what caſes, nor turne over the leaves to ſee the cautions: but runs away with the Title many times even againſt the ſenſe of the Author. Thus, this hypocrite hath many wayes <hi>to put the ſtumbling-block of iniquity before his own face,</hi> which he <hi>ſetteth up as an idol in his own heart</hi>

                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.29</note>, no more than that his conſcience ſhould be a rule to another mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he is ſpecially careful that his own conſcience be not ſcandalized at his own practice. His firſt care is, to be <hi>fully perſwaded in his own minde</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 14.5</note>, that he may not be ſo <hi>unhappy</hi> as to <hi>condemn himſelf in the thing that he alloweth</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Ver. 22</note>. He may be miſtaken in his judgment: but, his conſcience will not ſuffer him to act, till his judgement at preſent be ſatisfied: that ſo, if after it appear that he was in an

                     <p>If he doubt in the leaſt, he refraineth the uſe of his liberty, becauſe therein no man is a loſer, unleſſe himſelf. He may ſuffer ſomewhat in going without ſome liberty which might gratifie his affections or pleaſure: but, there will be no loſſe in the peace of his conſcience, no civil warre in his boſome, no blot to his name. Wherefore he holdeth hard on Gods ſide againſt his own inclination: and, is partial for the Law, rather than for his own liberty: fearing leſt God and he ſhould not be of a minde. He cannot eaſily reſolve that to be lawful, at leaſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to which his corrupt heart ſo willingly and ſtrongly enclineth. He knoweth it to be a ſin to make bold with even an erroneous conſcience. Wherefore he ſtudieth the point of liberty, holding the doctrine deare; but, makes uſe of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to occaſion, ſo as he may be ſure not to abuſe it. He is jealous of any thing that preſſeth too much upon him, and is afraid of that liberty that may end in his own captivity.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite is like him that being much addicted to play, will, for want of company, play with himſelf, although he loſe by the hand: the true Chriſtian is like him, that will be no loſer by his own play.

                     <p>Secondly, ſome are publick perſons, and ſome are private; here alſo the Chriſtian is careful, if he cannot pleaſe both, to offend a private friend, than a Magiſtrate; a brother, rather than the Father of his Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, becauſe of weak ones, ſome are in the right, ſome in the wrong, he will herein follow <hi>Paul,</hi> rather than <hi>Peter.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> (being better adviſed in that point) would rather have the Jewes offended, who took offence without cauſe, than the Gentiles ſcandalized by <hi>Peters</hi> cauſleſſe diſſimulation. <hi>Peter</hi> might ſay, <hi>both are brethren,</hi> both are <hi>weak;</hi> whom ſhould I rather reſpect, but mine own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?

                     <p>And firſt, in the extremity of <hi>defect,</hi> he is offended at no thing, with no body. No mans converſation offendeth him. He thanks God, he findes no fault with the world, nor ſees reaſon why any man ſhould take offence. He never ſaw worſe than himſelf (and herein you may take him at his word.)

                        <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 10.3</note>; at leaſt he excuſeth them. God forbid, ſaith he, they ſhould be ſo bad as you make them. They may be in ſome things a little too blame, but not half ſo much as you deem them.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, If he take no offence, what have we to do with him here? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe both extremes belong to the ſame kinde: and yet much more, becauſe he that takes offence at none, cannot but be offended at thoſe that take offence at any. He wonders that any ſhould finde fault with the times, manners, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and, while he commends his own charity, he muſt needs condemn their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſeem to be much ſcandalized at it, as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when for telling them their own, that they <hi>were of their father the devil;</hi> they ſaid, <hi>he had a devil</hi>

<pb n="565" facs="tcp:63232:290"/> that any ſhould be ſo harſh as to condemn it. If he hear Chriſt himſelfe threaten damnation to the Prieſts and Scribes, thoſe unfaithful husbandmen that firſt ſlew the <hi>ſervants,</hi> then the <hi>Son of the Lord of the Vineyard;</hi> he is of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minde, that ſaid, <hi>God ferbid</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 20.16</note>. It is his charity, his modeſty, that he is no Cenſurer, no Judge, no Medler with other mens matters. He leaves that to other men.

He hath every ones good word, for a quiet man, a kind neighbour, you ſhall never heare him finde fault, ſay his neighbours: it were well your rigid Miniſters and Preciſians would learn of him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To ſuch a generation it was that Chriſt ſometimes ſaid, <hi>the world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil</hi>

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Luke 6.26</note>; ſo there is a <hi>woe</hi> to them that ſpeak well of all men, and of all things, <hi>calling evil good</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Iſa. 5.20</note>. For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do all men ſpeak well of this hypocrite, becauſe he ſpeaketh ſo favourably of them.

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 5 11</note>. This man findes no fault with the world, (notwithſtanding this charge,) nor the world with him: but God, with both; but chiefly with the hypocrite, by whoſe means, vices are cheriſhed, wicked men hardened, repentance obſtructed, and others more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily drawn into the ſame courſe of wickedneſſe, when they ſee him that is a great Profeſſor of Religion, defend and countenance it.</p>
                     <p>He wanteth grace, that is not ſenſible of ſin: but, he that makes ſuch ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his commendation, doth (as the wiſe man in another caſe ſpeaketh) <hi>exalt folly</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Prov. 14.29</note>. He that is not offended at the old man in himſelf, hath no part of the New: and he that is not offended with vice in the world, hath no ſtock of true vertue in himſelf. As a woman not offended with filthy talk and behaviour, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſumed chaſte; ſo he that is not ſcandalized at the wickedneſſe of the world, muſt needs be preſumed a <hi>friend</hi> unto it, and an <hi>enemy to God</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Jam 4.4</note>. And ſo much the rather, becauſe he will quickly be ſenſible of, and highly offended with any thing that croſſeth his own particular. No man more punctilious in things that concern his own honour, profit, or delight, in his greateſt inſenſibleneſſe of the honour of God.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>the true Chriſtian is offended,</hi>

                        <note n="y" place="margin">Prov. 29.27</note>. A Chriſtian hath ſo much of the <hi>godly nature</hi> in him, as makes him not only to avoid, but to hate <hi>the corruptions which are in the world through luſt</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4</note>: and, not only corrupt luſts, but corrupt men. <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee, O Lord?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and am not I grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee?

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 139.21.22</note>. The more like he is unto God, the more perfectly he <hi>abhorreth every falſe way.</hi> As the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God did continually <hi>ſtrive</hi> with the old world till it was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 6.3</note> And the <hi>ſoule</hi> of <hi>righteous Lot,</hi> was <hi>vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.7</note>; ſo, his ſoul mourneth and <hi>crieth</hi> within him <hi>for all the abominations that are done</hi> in the world<note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 9.4</note>. He cannot bear the wickedneſſe of the world, although all the world ſhould riſe up againſt him for it.</p>
                     <p>But, ſaith the world, is it a weakneſſe to be ſo apt to take offence? Indeed, ſo to be offended as to fall and offend, is a great weakneſſe, yea, a ſin; as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, who ſaid, <hi>my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well nigh ſlipt</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 73.2</note>: or, to be offended unneceſſarily at that which is no ſin, is a weakneſſe, as he who in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcience, <hi>eateth not, and judgeth him that eateth.</hi> But, ſo to be offended as to condemn evil in others, and to avoid it in himſelf, is a point of Chriſtian ſtrength. Chriſt himſelf was thus <hi>offended</hi> at <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 16.23</note>; and God with the old world, whoſe wickedneſſe <hi>grieved him at the heart</hi> ſo farre, that he reſolved to <hi>deſtroy man and beaſt from the face of the earth</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 6.6, 7</note>. The Chriſtian therefore accounts it no weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him, no diſhonour to him, to be offended at ſin wherever he findes it; but,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:63232:291"/> rather prayeth for ſuch weakneſſe (as the world calls tenderneſſe of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) which may make him more conformable to his Maker.</p>
                     <p>Thus, this hypocrite had rather offend God, by not taking offence at men for that wherein they offend God, than not gain applauſe from men, even with the diſhonour of God: the true Chriſtian had rather offend all the world by taking offence at the wickedneſſe of it, than be unſenſible of the diſhonour thereby done unto God. The one will be a gainer from men, even by that which makes God a loſer; the other will loſe all, and himſelf too, (as to the world) rather than raiſe himſelf a name by ſuch <hi>unjuſt gain.</hi>

                     <p>He joyneth in word and in ſhew with them that reprove the evil of the times.

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 23.28</note>.

                        <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.12</note>. He is as a child wantonly brought up, ſo way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and peeviſh, that it is a trouble to deviſe how to pleaſe him: and the more he perceiveth men willing to give him content, the further he is from being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now, that he findes himſelf to be ſome body, and to be look't upon as <hi>Cenſor morum,</hi> a Maſter-Corrector of manners, he ſets no bounds to his tyrannie in this kinde.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ignorance breeds this humour: for he that walks in the dark ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at every ſtraw, <hi>as he that walketh in the night, ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">John 11.12</note>. But, moſt commonly pride lies at the root of this diſtemper, and appears in every branch of it, as ivy about, and above the tree which it hath encompaſſed. For it ſeemeth to him to be a kinde of command and lordſhip, when he, though never ſo mean, (and commonly the meaner, the prouder) may take upon him to judge and condemn all that come in his way, as treſpaſſers againſt him. It pleaſeth him well to think that the world begins to veile to his cenſure, as bound to follow his judgement, diſcretion, and faſhion; or, he will whip them, as beggars, about the Town, and laſh them double at every Great Mans door, as appears in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy which he ſheweth in making capital offences of indifferent things.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe, <hi>the adviſed Christian is offended with nothing but what is truly evil.</hi>

                     <p>If he take offence, it is neceſſity that puts him upon it.

His charity is ſuch, that he had rather not take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if he could reaſonably excuſe, or remove what is offenſive. He is ſo much offended with his own corruption, that he hardly and rarely taketh offence at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

He holds it to-be in vain to make war abroad, till the civil and inteſtine quarrels be (not compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and quieted by treaty, but) decided by the ſword at home. Therefore her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh truce with the world, that he may the better proſecute and finiſh his warre at home. Have not I <hi>a right eye,</hi> or, <hi>a right hand</hi>

                     <p>And, if he do not impute the fault to their Profeſſion, as prophane wretches do; yet he chargeth it upon their hypocriſie: as they who being adultereſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are moſt apt to charge the ſame fault upon others who deſerve not ſo to be charged. The truth is, he ſeeth perhaps that the other hath out-ſhone him, and is in better eſteem among the godly, than himſelf. Therefore he is now glad at heart to ſee him down, that he may trample upon him, and point at him ſo, that all may take notice of himſelf as being the better of the two. And the greater the fall of the other is, the more advantage he makes of it to himſelf; not to be more watchful over himſelf as he is commanded<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.12</note>: but only to trample on the other, which is forbidden<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.2</note>.</p>
                     <p>Yea, he ſo exclaimeth againſt the leaſt ſlips of Profeſſors, that he ſticks not to <hi>tell it in Gath, and to publiſh it in the streets of Askelon,</hi> cauſing the very boyes and girles of the <hi>Philiſtines to rejoyce, and the uncircumciſed to triumph</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Nor doth he content himſelf thus to take offence at real offences of the godly, but he is as clamorous and bitter againſt them for imagined aberrations that ſuit not with his humour and fancie; forſaking the Aſſemblings and fellowſhip of the Saints, and excommunicating himſelf, becauſe he cannot caſt out whom he will, and what he will. And, in the mean time none ſo partial to himſelf not only in doubtful things, but in things notoriouſly wicked and loathſom, nouriſhing groſſe ſins in himſelf from the examples of the falls of the Saints departed.

Therefore have we laboured, in the former <hi>Part,</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, to drive thoſe Crowes</hi> from theſe <hi>ſacrifices</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 15.11</note>; and, with a cudgel as it were, to keep off this dog.</p>
                     <p>And, when he heareth of the <hi>infirmities</hi> of Gods children, he is ready to <hi>traduce</hi> them, and their Profeſſion, ſaying, <hi>theſe be the godly ones; as bad, I warrant you, as any other; as angry, covetous, &amp;c:</hi> and, to <hi>palliate his own reigning ſins; I need not be ſo much aſhamed and troubled at my petty oathes; or, for being ſometimes a little over-ſeen with drink; or, for not ſo ſtrictly obſerving the Sabbath: the beſt, we ſee, are bad; We are all ſinners. God forgive us, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, he <hi>groweth proud,</hi> and exalteth himſelf above <hi>the generation of Gods children; I that make</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no ſuch ſtrict Profeſſion, would have been ſorry to have given ſo bad an example.</hi> Thus, if any one profeſſing goodneſſe appear to come ſhort of his Profeſſion, he concludeth himſelf (who is the hypocrite) to be good, becauſe the other, in ſome thing, is found to be bad; and, the other (who is the true Chriſtian) to be the hypocrite, becauſe himſelf, in ſome particular commands over natural infirmities and paſſions, doth out-ſtrip him.</p>
                     <p>For theſe, and the like cauſes, many are glad to ſee the weakneſſes, and to look upon the <hi>nakedneſſes</hi> of Gods dear children, that they may trample upon them, and glory over them, as being themſelves the better of the two; when their own hearts cannot but tell them, that themſelves are wicked. And, for theſe, and the like cauſes, have I undertaken this ſecond part, to beſtride the godly, being down; that, ſuch as are worſe may not too much inſult over him in his fall; not himſelf, deſpair of riſing again, in the right uſe of the true meanes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>Divers, perhaps, will gape after this Argument, and, deſire to hear all that may be ſaid <hi>of a Christian in his infirmities,</hi> becauſe they intend to be Chriſtians; yet are <hi>laden with divers luſts</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.6</note>, which they hope to bring under the ſame head of <hi>infirmities,</hi> that they mean not to part withal. But ſuch ſhall finde, that <hi>infirmities</hi> reſolved upon, tolerated, and cheriſhed, are no longer <hi>infirmities,</hi> but <hi>reigning ſins:</hi> which (however they borrow a Livery from the true Chriſtian, that he who weareth it, may ſeem to belong unto God;) will, in the iſſue, be the ruine and damnation of all that flatter themſelves in the retaining of them, under the names of <hi>infirmities.</hi>

                     <p>No true Chriſtian favoureth himſelf in any kinde, or degree of ſin; be it but a ſin of infirmity, to which the very natural conſtitution of his body maketh him ſubject. Nay; he deſireth not only to better himſelf while he is in this world; but, to bury all his infirmities, before himſelf be buried: and, to paſſe into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter world,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.22</note> before he leave this, by being every day made more <hi>free from ſin (i);</hi> and as having the very skin of <hi>the old man,</hi> ſtript over his eares, and hang'd upon the hedge, that he may ſtand by, and throw ſtones at it. He no leſſe deſireth to be freed from ſin, than to be happy with Chriſt; as knowing, that there is no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with Chriſt, without freedome from ſin.</p>
                     <p>Herein, the hypocrite ſheweth as little ſincerity, as in the former <hi>differences.</hi> For, albeit he ſeemeth to reade, with great delight and admiration, the ſtories of noble and glorious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and zealous <hi>Confeſſors</hi> deceaſed, whom, as <hi>Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> he may admire: yet, it pleaſeth him not, to hear of any, better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that are yet alive, whom he hath no minde to imitate; rather would he look upon thoſe that are worſe, that he may appear better; as, the <hi>Phariſee</hi> beheld the <hi>Publicane.</hi> For men going out of the world, not to be worldly, is but that which becomes them: But, for him that lives in the world, it misbecometh him not to favour a little of the world, becauſe he ſeeth that the beſt, while they continue here, are worldly, although not worldlings.</p>

See as much <hi>infirmity</hi> in his neighbour, and talk as loudly of it, as you will: <hi>this liketh him well,</hi> becauſe hereby, he that is but a ſlimy ſlough, ſhineth. But, if you talk of the Chriſtians better part, this makes the hypocrite appear like a candle lighted, while the Sun ſhineth upon it. That which ſhould be in the hypocrite, and yet is not, muſt not be named as being in the Chriſtian, who truly hath it. He liketh well the Chriſtians clog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not his wings; his <hi>blackneſſe,</hi> to be the hypocrites foile; but, not his <hi>comelineſſe,</hi> which is the hypocrites ſhame. Or, if he look upon ſome <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the preſent time, he puts it off, as they that, beholding faire pictures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves foule or deformed, <hi>theſe pictures</hi> (ſay they) <hi>were drawn as it pleaſed the Painter:</hi> a beautiful face is the envie of deformity.

                     <p>But, with the true Chriſtian it is far otherwiſe, whether he look upon the <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> or <hi>Vertues</hi> of ſuch as feare God.

                     <p>There are divers <hi>differences</hi> to be ſeen in a Chriſtian. He differeth from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who as <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Mal. 4.2</note> hath no <hi>Epicycle</hi> of approach to the earth, and is never out of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> line of perfect holineſſe; whereas the Chriſtian erreth or wandreth as the <hi>Planets,</hi> yet within the latitude of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> the way of life, bounded with the <hi>Tropicks</hi> of faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>He differeth from <hi>Saints Triumphant</hi> in heaven, who are elevated higher than to be ſubject to any <hi>Eccentrick</hi> motions. Some have ſtrained their wits to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the Sun to be the <hi>Center</hi> of the world, and the earth and elements to move round about it. Sure, in ſpiritual things, it is no Paradox. Chriſt, <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi> is the Center of <hi>the New Heavens and the New Earth</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Eſay 65.17</note>; and of the world to come.

                     <p>Yea, the Chriſtian differeth from himſelf too. His <hi>Zodiack</hi> of goodneſſe hath a latitude of degrees, wherein his graces, like Planets do variouſly wander. It is alwayes day with him, but not alwayes Summer, or Sun-ſhine. It is ſometimes as ſtormy with him in his voyage to heaven, as it was with <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſailed to <hi>Rome, when neither Sun, nor ſtarres, in many dayes appeared, and no ſmall tempeſt lay on them, ſo that all hope that ho and his company ſhould be ſaved, was taken away</hi>

Once the Sun was up, and the morning light did truly ariſe, and ſhine upon his heart: therefore he concludeth that, after the ſtorme, there will come a calme; and, where the Sun is once riſen, it never ſetteth ſo, as never to return into the ſame <hi>Horizon.</hi> Therefore it is <hi>day</hi> ſtill, be it never ſo dark with him <hi>that ſitteth in darkneſſe, and hath no light.</hi>

                     <p>And this comfort the true Chriſtian hath from his infirmities; that, as he who is pur-blinde, never comes to be ſtark blinde: ſo the Chriſtian even by infirmities is ſecured (through watchfulneſſe) from a total defection from God, or his grace.

                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 John 3.9</note>. Next, how, even then, he is not as the unregenerate, even when, haply, he doth the ſame things, or worſe, (but not with the ſame minde,) becauſe, <hi>with the minde he still ſerveth the Law of God</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 7.25</note>.

That ſo it may appear, that all his <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is from without, by <hi>Sun-burning;</hi> not from complexion within: or, if from within, not from his conſtitution, as a new creature; but, by accident, and through diſeaſe; as of the <hi>black Jaundice,</hi> &amp;c. which may alter the colour of the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, until it be healed; of which <hi>healing,</hi> the Chriſtian is ſure not to fail<note n="r" place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4</note>: but, with <hi>Naaman,</hi> to be, not only reſtored, but advanced to a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition<note n="s" place="margin">2 King. 5.14</note>.</p>
                     <p>That he is <hi>black,</hi> himſelf will not deny: but, how he becometh ſo, is a work of difficulty, ſo as to diſtinguiſh him from the hypocrite in <hi>white.</hi> For the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereof, we ſhall, firſt, take a view of him in his <hi>common</hi> infirmities which do adhere to, or may befal every Chriſtian alike; and then, deſcend to ſuch <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> infirmities wherewith ſome Chriſtians more than others, are clogged and burdened: and, in every of theſe, whether <hi>oommon,</hi> or <hi>ſpecial,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> and beauty that he ſtill retaineth, beyond the beſt dreſſe, and paint of the hypocrite that is moſt apt to cenſure him for his <hi>blackneſſe.</hi>

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5.12</note>. But grace is a perſonal Priviledge, becauſe a free gift of God<note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 2.8</note> only to thoſe, <hi>on whom he will have mercy</hi>

                     <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> when he begat <hi>Seth,</hi> that <hi>he begat a ſon in his own likeneſſe</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 5.3</note>: but not ſo, when he begat <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Abel,</hi> albeit both of theſe were begotten in the ſame image; becauſe the Holy Ghoſt knew that <hi>Abel</hi> was to die without iſſue: and, <hi>Caines</hi> iſſue were all ſwept away by the <hi>Flood.</hi> Therefore, he noteth this in the procreation of <hi>Seth,</hi> in whom mankinde, as well good as bad, were (after the drowning <hi>of the old world</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5</note>) to be propagated to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>That all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> might therefore behold their firſt corrupt original, God more eſpecially noteth this in the generation of <hi>Seth,</hi> that <hi>Adam begat him, in his own image;</hi> not, <hi>after the image of him that created him,</hi> innocent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note n="f" place="margin">Eccl. 7.29</note>; nor, as he was renewed by grace, imperfectly: but, as he was corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own perſonal defection from God, without any corrupt proclivity in his nature enclining him thereunto; which <hi>likeneſſe</hi> is rightly termed his <hi>own,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that whereto he had miſ-formed himſelf, and whereby he begat a ſon as ſinful as himſelf, to whom the Father communicated not only the ſubſtance of his body, but the depravation of his nature, which ever ſince was, and ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from father to ſon, until <hi>time ſhall be no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not the holieſt of all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> were ever borne holy by propagation from their Parents. <hi>David, a man after Gods own heart</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 13.14</note>, brought ſin with him into the world from his firſt home and place of being, even the mould of his mothers womb, as himſelf ingenuouſly confeſſeth upon woful experience; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 51.5</note>. Nor did e-the holieſt father beget an holy ſon, but a ſinful iſſue (as kernels of ſweet apples bring forth crab-trees;) witneſſe <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">2 Chro. 33.1, 2</note>; <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Joſiah</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">2 Chro. 36.5, &amp;c.</note>; and many moe. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives the reaſon, becauſe holy men beget children as men, not as Saints: and ſo, as the pureſt wheat that is moſt carefully winnowed from the chaffe, being ſowed, yieldeth wheat with as much chaffe, as if the firſt ſeed had never been winnowed. So doth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt ſanctified Parents, until Chriſt come <hi>with his fan in his hand, and throughly purge his floor</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 3.12</note> from the power of corruption here, and from all being of it hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>corruption,</hi> in every birth are twins, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> in the wombe of <hi>Rebeccah.</hi> But, as twins that are borne together, do ſeldom die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo it is in this caſe. A Chriſtian borne with corruption out-liveth it. For, while he liveth the natural life in this world, corruption beginneth to die, <hi>being mortified by the Spirit</hi>
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8.13</note>: and, when he dieth out of this world, to live in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:63232:303"/> his corruption and he are for ever parted. And ſo, he out-groweth it here, and out-liveth it hereafter.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>corruption in the hypocrite, being borne with him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>becometh his death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He finds that Proverb, <hi>(Save a thief from the Gallowes, and he will cut your throat)</hi> verified upon himſelf. He lets ſin live, and ſin makes him die, not only a natural death, to which all are ſubject; but even an <hi>eternal death,</hi> which is <hi>the wages of ſin</hi>
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6.23</note>, ſuffered to live. While the Chriſtian ſtarveth corruption by <hi>abſtaining from all appearance of evil</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.22</note>, <hi>making no proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 13.14</note>; the hypocrite feedeth and pampereth it, <hi>fulfilling tht deſires of the fleſh, and of the minde</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 2.3</note>: and ſo <hi>ſin liveth, and he dieth</hi>
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 7.9</note>. He feedeth ſin, as the Pellican doth her young, till ſhe have deſtroyed her ſelf by feeding them.</p>
                     <p>Sin is to the unregenerate, as ſtrong waters to him that is over-gone with the dropſie: he will have them, and cannot be without them, although he know ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently that they will be his death. If there be no hope of cure (ſaith he, when he never goes about it,) let me have content while I live; whereas ſuch content haſteneth his death. Sin is to him as water in its proper place and element; not heavy, but pleaſing: becauſe he lives in it, and it in him. He can no more live out of it, than a fiſh without water; or, himſelf, without aire. But this will prove to him, as <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> or the dead ſea to the fiſhes playing in the ſtreams of <hi>Jordan,</hi> they play ſo long in <hi>Jordan,</hi> till that river and they with it, be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>lake of Sodom</hi> where preſently they die; for, he <hi>that liveth after the fleſh, is ſure to die</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 8.13</note>; and for more aſſurance, <hi>he is dead while he liveth</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6</note>; yea, <hi>twice dead, pluckt up by the roots</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Jude 12</note>; dead-borne, and dead-living ends in a double death-dying; for that not only the ſoul is ſeparated from the body, but both from God, and that for ever<note n="w" place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.9</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian is as <hi>Paul, dying daily</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.31</note>, and thereby out-liveth death: the hypocrite is as <hi>the woman living in pleaſure,</hi> (as rats that lick up their own bane) <hi>dead while he liveth</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6</note>. In the one, corruption is as a man dead in law, condemned, and <hi>nailed to the Croſſe of Chriſt</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 5.24</note>; in the other, it is as <hi>Barabbas releaſed,</hi> while <hi>Christ</hi> is crucified, which will certainly end in the dreadful deſtruction of all thoſe that make ſuch a choice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Chriſtian hath ſin dwelling in him, but not reigning over him.</hi>

                     <p>Sin remaineth in him, ſometimes through his own fault, in great part. For, as the Iſraelites under the conduct of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> having ſubdued the Canaanites, did not expel them when they had maſtered them, and afterwards could not do it, when they would: and were therefore reproved of the <hi>Angel</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Judg. 2.1, 2</note>: ſo the regenerate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing their corruptions, do not make that haſte, nor uſe that care in driving out this Canaanitiſh brood as they ought; and therefore are juſtly not only cumbred and vexed with them as with <hi>thornes in their ſides</hi>

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:63232:304"/> in him, at leaſt not in that ſtrength, in which now it doth.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes God permitteth the abode of corruption in the beſt, in this life; as of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> refuſing <hi>to drive them</hi> out himſelf, when he ſeeth the Chriſtian remiſſe, and careleſſe to do full execution upon the fleſh ſo ſoon as he hath <hi>gotten the victory through Jeſus Christ.</hi> This brings him, as ſometimes it did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This makes original corrutpion within, to root it ſelf much the faſter, even when we pluck up the weeds ſpringing out of it as faſt as they appear above-ground; as the moars of nettles ſpread the farther and faſter in the ground, by how much oftner they are mowed: yet mowed they muſt be, or they would over-ſpread, and choak all.

                     <p>Howbeit He that cauſeth light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, bringeth much good out of this evil: making it an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt preſumption and ſelf-love, bringing the Chriſtian, notwithſtanding all his graces, upon his knees in an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his own continued vileneſſe, for which he <hi>abhorreth himſelf in duſt and aſhes</hi>

                        <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 7.24</note>, becauſe though deſtinated to death, yet it is not altogether dead; it is ſtill ſtirring, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, not only for life; but, to do what miſchief more it can, before it yeeld up the ghoſt. <hi>Paul</hi> found it ſo, and ſo doth every Chriſtian, who looks upon himſelf every day as in danger to be wounded by this body, that would kill him out-right by way of revenge, if it lay in his power.</p>

                     <p>He ſtill <hi>complaineth of the Law in his members,</hi> albeit <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus hath freed him from the Law of ſinne and of death</hi>
                        <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note>. He is <hi>freed</hi> from the <hi>reigning</hi> power, but not from the <hi>tyranny</hi> of that Law; from the <hi>death</hi> of it, but not from the buffettings of it. It is a Law in him, but not unto him. It would ſway with him, but it cannot have dominion over him. Rebels, up in arms, make and proclaim many Lawes of their own framing, by which they would bind the whole Country: but it is in the power of the ſubjects not to admit them. The Pope makes many Lawes, Canons, &amp;c. (little better many of them than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) which are urged upon all, but not received by all; (for, the <hi>Venetians</hi> refuſe them: ſo his Bulls were many of them ſent hither, but not admitted;) being Lawleſſe Lawes againſt the Lawes both of God, and of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet are all theſe Lawes, in the intent of him that urgeth them, and in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe Traytors that receive them. And, haply, ſuch Lawes prevaile by the ſtrong hand of tyranny, ſo that even they that are good ſubjects are forced ſometimes to bear the burden of them, though they do not allow, but abhorre them. In like manner it is with this Law of corruption; A Law it may be for Out-Lawes, not for Chriſts ſubjects: becauſe it is a Law againſt the Law of God, and of Chriſt, whereto the regenerate man is a ſworn ſubject, and wherein only he delighteth, ſo far forth as he is regenerate,</p>
                     <p>He wiſheth there were no Law, but that of grace, and of God, which was <hi>Adams</hi> condition in innocency: but now, when he is converted, grace findeth in him a Law of ſin formerly eſtabliſhed, which is to be abrogated as it may, not all at once, but by little and little. In Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> the Law was firſt given in Tables which were of Gods making; and the Law, of his own writing. But, thoſe Tables being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there were other Tables wherein God wrote his Law afreſh; But, the Tables were made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not by God. So now, the Chriſtian feeleth the finger of God in the writing of the Law in his heart: but the heart is ſuch as God findeth it, and as man hath made it: that is, in great part, corrupt and ſinful. This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſet up in him in another Law, which (to his grief) the Law of grace, can hardly maſter.</p>

                     <p>The Law of ſin, in it ſelf (and to him that knowes the baſeneſſe, and the miſchief of ſin) is an heavy burden. Nothing can be more grievous then to receive a Law from ſin, to obey ſin as a man would obey a Law of his Soveraign. For, a Law of ſin cannot but be unjuſt, a Law of oppreſſion; yea, a Law, of death: a Law whereby ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as it were with warrant againſt God; a Law, which muſt be obeyed upon pain of death; and being obeyed, gives no other wages or reward, but death, yea eternal death. Yet this is the law by which alone the unregenerate deſires to be governed.</p>
                     <pb n="597" facs="tcp:63232:308"/>
                     <p>But there is more in a <hi>Law of ſinne,</hi> than bare obedience to it. It hath a bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inchanting nature to make the ſinner <hi>willing</hi> to obey, to engage in a corrupt courſe, ſo as not eaſily, or ſuddenly to be taken off: and this <hi>liketh him,</hi> he <hi>loveth it:</hi> there is hardly any reclaiming of him.

                        <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 81.12.</note>; ſo that it is one of the greateſt plagues, ſo to obey it; as it is one of the greateſt ſinnes to acknowledge ſuch a Law, and to plead for it; <hi>it is my nature, my cuſtome, my dayly practiſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I cannot help it. You must pardon me, talk no more of it; for, I muſt, and will do it.</hi> This is, not onely to have a Law impoſed, or obeyed; but, to hold a Parliament, and to make that perpetual, which before was taken up onely for a Trial, till the next Seſſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian is under the <hi>Law of ſinne,</hi> as a man travelling in his way, is taken by Thieves and Robbers, and, after many wounds received, is compelled to be under their Lawes, to ſay, and do what they command; but, with purpoſe to obey no longer, than till he can get from under their power; which he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, by all wayes and means he can: The hypocrite, is under that Law, as the Thieves themſelves that make it, expecting a benefit from it, and, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count yielding ready obedience to it: the one is extreamely troubled that he is obnoxious to it: the other is jolly and jocund that he is governed by it. The one receiveth ſinne as a blow; the other, as a Law that is welcome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The true Chriſtian findeth that Law of ſin, in his members; not in his mind, or inner <label type="milestone">

                        <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 49.20.</note>. The beaſt acteth by the members of his body; not as acted by reaſon, but ſenſe: ſo doth a man, till regenerated; not as acted by grace, but by ſenſuality and corruption.</p>
                     <p>And even after regeneration, <hi>ſinne</hi> gives <hi>a Law;</hi> but not to the ſoul, as it becomes the purer part by grace; but yet, to the ſoul, as well as to the body, ſo farre forth as the ſoul is in part unpurified.

But, as a groſſe bodily member, not yet enlivened and quickned by the Spirit of grace.

                     <p>There is therefore in every regenerated man, a medly of <hi>fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out every part of ſoul and body.

                     <p>He findeth that the mind, ſo farre as it is made ſpiritual, guideth him by the Law of nature or of grace, as it ſelf is guided by God.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Or herein, he rather dealeth with the <hi>Old man,</hi> as his Lord hath done by that <hi>strong man armed,</hi> the Devil, <hi>keeping his Palace</hi> and <hi>his goods in peace:</hi> for Chriſt, <hi>a ſtronger than he, came upon him, and overcame him, and taking from him all his armour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he truſted, he divided the ſpoyle</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 11.21, 22. Col. 2.13.</note>. So the Chriſtian never gives over fighting with the fleſh, till he hath put it to the Sword; and, as <hi>David</hi> dealt with <hi>Goliah,</hi> take off <hi>his head, and given his carcaſſe to the fowls of the ayre, and to the wild beaſts of the field</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 17.46</note>.</p>
                     <p>Yet, as, notwithſtanding all the policy and vigilancy of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme <hi>Iſrael, Saul</hi> or <hi>Jonathan</hi> might catch <hi>a Speare,</hi> ſo, for all the endeavour and diligence of grace, corruption may haply, catch an <hi>eye,</hi> and cauſe it to look <hi>after a woman to luſt after her</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note>; or, ſome other member<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>make it a weapon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe unto ſinne,</hi> ere the Chriſtian be aware, (as we ſee in <hi>David</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">2 Sam. 11.3</note>) to the wounding and endangering of the whole man. Therefore he is the more careful to keep his watch, and will never make league, or truce with it, upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>In the unregenerate and hypocrite this Rebel hath peaceable abode,</hi>

                     <p>Corruption in him hath the whole houſe of nature for his Arſenal, and quarter. He commandeth all; and welcome. He either feareth no Warre, or prepareth to make reſiſtance. Every <hi>member</hi> is a <hi>weapon,</hi> and every faculty is an Armourer, to forge and furbuſh the Artillery of ſin. He expects a forraign Warre from the New man and the Law of God, which he extreamely hateth and oppoſeth, and therefore calls in this <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> this Egyptian King to his aid, although a Rebel to his Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>And ſo farre doth he give up his power to this rebellious In-mate, as he is content to let the very Law it ſelf to make him more wicked than otherwiſe he would be<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 7.8. &amp; ver. 13.</note>, meerely to comply with this tyrannical gueſt. For, as the lime burneth, by pouring
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:63232:310"/> on water, which ſhould in reaſon quench it; ſo concupiſcence is increaſed by the Law, which ſhould by right deſtroy and aboliſh it. And ſo, the Warre which ſhould be waged with this Rebel is carried on againſt the Law, and that with ſuch ſpight, as to do whatſoever may croſſe the Law, upon this very reaſon only that he will croſſe it.</p>
                     <p>But the hypocrite in this ſtate feareth no Civil Warre, between him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or rather Lord, the <hi>Old man</hi> within him. All is quiet within; ſaving as Thieves ſometimes fall out, and wicked men wrangle one with another among themſelves: ſo poſſibly the hypocrite and corruption, upon ſome points may jangle and ſquabble. But whether ſide ſoever prevaileth, it matters not: ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are ſure to be no looſers, but gainers by it. For, by this diviſion, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or government of ſin becometh more certain, and more dreadful. When the breach is made up, the hypocrite muſt part with ſomewhat more than he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the other, who at firſt ſeemed to be confined within ſome certain limits and lawes, by degrees comes to exerciſe an abſolute arbitrary tyranny; and the hypocrite dares do no more, but ſay, <hi>I thank you, Sir.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian oppoſing ſin as a Rebel, is at peace with God; the hypocrite entertaining ſin, as a friend maketh himſelf a Rebel. Corruption in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is like a <hi>Tyrone</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> affronted by the royal forces, till he be maſtered and made priſoner by the forces of Chriſt, the graces of the Spirit: in the other, it is like the <hi>Great Turk</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ruling all by power, without reſiſtance, yet without right.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ature is many wayes a ſtep-mother to grace; and this way among the reſt, that, by means of bodily defects and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes by birth, or happening afterwards by Providence, the vigour of the minde is much weakened, eſpecially in the purſuit of heavenly things: And, the Chriſtian, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened, until grace ſo far prevail, as to compenſate the defects of nature. And this it doth, by ſupplying him with a <hi>comelineſſe</hi> of a better kinde than that of nature, or of the body: becauſe it not only covereth the deformities of nature, but advanceth the beauties of grace.</p>
                     <p>This is a ſubject wherein not all, but ſome Chriſtians only, are concerned: namely, ſuch as labour under ſome particular blemiſhes, or defects, happening in reſpect of <hi>Nation, wicked and unworthy Parents, illegitimate procreation, bodily defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> or <hi>infirmity</hi> by <hi>lameneſſe</hi> or <hi>ſickneſſe.</hi> Of all which, the Holy Ghoſt taketh notice; but in different manner. When he looks upon theſe things in relation to the Law, he marks them with a cole. When he beholds them in a Chriſtian freed from that law, yet ſubject to theſe, or any of theſe infirmities, he ſpeaks comfort and encouragement.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, or moſt of them were prejudicial, under the Old Teſtament, in relation to the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Law. A <hi>stranger</hi> or <hi>ſervant</hi> uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might not eat the <hi>Paſſeover</hi>

                     <p>But, under the Goſpel; and, in relation to the Covenant of Grace, (even <hi>while the first Tabernacle,</hi> and Levitical Ordinances <hi>were yet ſtanding,</hi> as well as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence) <hi>Nation, Parentage, Beauty, Strength, &amp;c.</hi> were not, are not either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acceptance, or furtherances unto grace, (although bleſſings in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;) but, for the moſt part, through abuſes, hindrances thereunto. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the want of thoſe things cannot exclude from grace; albeit it may daunt, and weaken the hands of ſome, ſubject to ſuch defects; until, by the help of grace, they be made truly holy, and ſo (notwithſtanding theſe diſadvantages) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>more excellent than their neighbours</hi>

                     <p>The beſt Chriſtians are not woven altogether of the woof of grace: nor, the worſt men, with all the imperfections of nature. The beſt Chriſtian is mixed with the warp of nature, not only as nature is corrupted in qualities by ſin, but as deformed in the ſubſtance and faculties as a puniſhment of the firſt ſinne. And this nature hath many knots and knurles in it, that will ſhew themſelves in the wearing, notwithſtanding all the endeavours of grace to ſmooth them. Howbeit, in the eyes of God, ſuch a Chriſtian, ſo prejudiced by nature, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more beautiful than the beſt of thoſe, who are <hi>warp, all nature.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Where grace interveneth not, it is a true rule, <hi>crooked bodies, crooked ſoules.</hi> And it is as true, of all other blemiſhes of nature, and bodily deformities. God doth not leave thoſe marks of his diſpleaſure and juſt indignation againſt ſinne in general, to be as bare bunches in a tree, or as ſcarres that are healed in thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons ſo deformed; but, as Items and warnings to all that behold them, to take more ſpecial heed of them, as of thoſe that are more than ordinarily wicked and dangerous, where grace changeth not nature, by expelling thoſe more than ordinary fumes and ſpumes of corrupt nature, out of ſuch ſtigmatized bodies which naturally hold more of wickedneſſe than others, as the wens or kernels diſperſed into ſeveral parts of the natural body, draw and ſuck up the ſuperfluities of nature that otherwiſe would diſtemper and oppreſſe it.</p>
                     <p>He hath alſo a <hi>woof</hi> added to his <hi>warp:</hi> not that of the regenerate, which is the <hi>woof</hi> of <hi>grace;</hi> but, of cuſtome, and ill manners, conformable to his defects of nature, body, or breeding. And ſo, being <hi>accuſtomed to do evil</hi>
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Jer. 13.23</note>; he cannot but be <hi>exceeding ſinful;</hi> and, the more meanes he hath to reclaim him, the more <hi>ſinful</hi> he becomes<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 7.13</note>. For, where deformity of body, or other defects or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements maketh a man to be ſleighted, jeered, or unacceptable, corruption of nature (without grace) puts him on to ſtudie revenge for the defects of nature; wherein, the devil exceedingly helpeth to make worſe a crooked ſoul in a deſpicable body. It was not for nothing that God would not admit ſuch to ſerve at his Altar, who uſeth not to take exception at ſuch bodily blemiſhes, but where he findes ſomething ſuitable thereunto in the ſoule, making it averſe from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian labouring under natural or adventitious diſcouragements, is like a ſhip well built, that can, by the help of a prudent guide, make uſe of a croſſe winde, to carry on his voyage to heaven: the hypocrite and unregenerate, following only nature, and ſtriving without grace, is as one that ſaileth to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as the winde and tide carry him.

                     <p>Even bodily health and ſtrength are great helps to ſpiritual aſſaults, which work more upon ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, age, &amp;c. than upon others in whom nature ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified can afford more helps to the inner man aſſaulted by frowardneſſe, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, timorouſneſſe and the like. Young men have more <hi>ſtrength</hi> than others over-worne by age: and, if they have the <hi>Word of God abiding in them,</hi> they are ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to <hi>overcome the evil one</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1 John 2.14</note>. The want therefore of health, ſtrength, vigour of ſpirits muſt needs be a great diſadvantage where-ever it lights: yet, where grace is and ruleth, theſe infirmities are an help to mortification, to patience, and to the neglect of worldly things.</p>
                     <p>For, the ſick ſerve God in ſuffering patiently, as their proper obedience: for, even Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to have <hi>learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Heb 5.8</note>. The ſoul many times gets health by the ſickneſſe of the body. <hi>David</hi> never attained to a better temper and meaſure of ſpiritual health, than when he was moſt over-laid with bodily ſickneſſe, perhaps procured for the extremity of grief for his ſinnes<note n="l" place="margin">Pſ. 6.6, 7, &amp;c. Pſal. 32.4, 5</note>. Hence, the <hi>Eunuch</hi> may take comfort, although he be <hi>a drie and barren tree,</hi> that, by grace, he hath even in <hi>Gods houſe, and within his walls, a place and name better than of ſons and daughters,</hi> and that God <hi>will give him an everlaſting name that ſhall not be cut off</hi>

                     <p>If he be diſabled from ſome ſins, he is the more addicted to other. The continued adulterer, when diſabled by his own wickedneſſe as well as by age, to act that ſin, is then as much in heart (if not more) a filthy perſon ſtill, as in his greateſt vigour of body; and, a greater teacher, and provoker of others to the ſame wickedneſſe. Men turne pandors; and harlots become bauds to others, not onely for lucre, but for love of the ſin. Otherwiſe other trades leſſe ſinful, and more advantagious would be taken up by them. That courſe of life which any man voluntarily taketh up, eſpecially if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and dangerous proclaimeth to all, which way the heart is moſt bent.</p>
                     <p>So witches, and other envious perſons, the more unable to wreak their teen upon ſuch as they hate, malice ſupplieth the defect of natural abilities, or of want of power, and opportunity: and, rather than faile, the devil himſelf is called in to aſſiſt them in their deviliſh deſignes. So others, grow more froward to all about them, in time of ſickneſſe, as being more impatient and murmuring againſt God, becauſe they have not health, lims, ſtrength, &amp;c. as well as others. Theſe, are not unlike the vaſſals of Antichriſt, juſtly ſuffering extraordinary plagues for their voluntary ſlavery, that <hi>gnawed their tongues for pain, and blaſphemed the God of heaven, becauſe of their paines and their ſores, but repented not of their deeds</hi>

                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian is as <hi>Job,</hi> patiently ſuffering the hand of God, and bleſſing his name, even when ſmitten not only in his goods and relations, but in his own perſon, ſo that <hi>his fleſh is cloathed with wormes, and clods of duſt, and his skinne broken, and become loathſome</hi>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many defects in the mind (which are great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to nature as well as to grace) ariſing from the body. Here, that holdeth, <hi>the ſoule followeth the temperature of the body.</hi> For, otherwiſe, all men being left unto themſelves, ſhould be either fooliſh or wicked, or wiſe and honeſt, alike; becauſe all mens ſoules are alike by Creation, and all alike partakers of original corruption. But nature is more boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to ſome than to others, even where there is not any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating grace from above, to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>Great and manifold is the difference in men, in regard of complexion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Some more witty, ſober, conſtant, &amp;c. ſome, more dull, blockiſh, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious, intemperate, fickle, &amp;c. Whence the Philoſophers are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge certain natural vertues, although they will not admit them to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, vertues properly ſo called. And, among vices, ſome are acknowledged to be natural, as other ill qualities are contracted by diſeaſe, evil company, high feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, idleneſſe, &amp;c. and ſome, bruitiſh, incident to none but to ſuch as are of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage diſpoſition, as it is noted of <hi>Agrippa Poſthumus,</hi> Grandchilde of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>

                     <p>In the <hi>wiſdom</hi> therefore, that is <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> (I mean not, corrupt wiſdom, but that which is natural, and according to reaſon) there may be difference between one man and another: and, the diſadvantage may fall to Gods childe, as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him <hi>in whom are hidden all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 2.3</note>, that <hi>the children of this world are in their generation, wiſer than the children of light</hi>

And ſuch are they of whom the Apoſtle thus; <hi>not many wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> meaning it, not of ſinful corruption, but of the emprovement of nature<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26</note>, which being renewed and aſſiſted by grace, makes a far greater emprovement than the world is capable of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>On the contrary, <hi>the unregenerate excuſeth the imperfections of his ſoul, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſins of his ſoule take Sanctuary under the temperature of his body; and he thinks this to be (if not warrant, yet) excuſe ſufficient for all his exorbitances. If overtaken with luſt, drunkenneſſe, choller, &amp;c. his plea is this; It is my nature, I cannot help it, the very conſtitution of my body carries me violently upon it, I hope God will not impute it, &amp;c. This Apology, although <hi>Nabal</hi> had not the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make for himſelf, yet <hi>Abigail</hi> his wife made it for him, to his ſhame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to his ſafety. <hi>Let not my Lord regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, ſo is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.25</note>. Even fools have ſo much wit, as to think all they do muſt paſſe without offence, becauſe of their folly, which wiſe men will rather contemn, than take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                     <p>But, the unregenerate under colour of fatuity, and defects of nature borne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, endeavours to make uſe of that plea to excuſe all that folly
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:63232:315"/> which he, by the ſinfulneſſe and malice of his heart, hath contracted, and as it were engraffed upon the other: yea, which he, without juſt cauſe of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the defects of nature, would father upon nature, to excuſe the wickedneſſe of his heart, when nature is no way deficient, but liberal to him. Thus, <hi>the foole</hi> (in the Original, it is, <hi>Nabal) hath ſaid in his heart there is no God</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 14.1</note>. It is not the natural fool, but <hi>Nabal</hi> that ſaith ſo. And, <hi>Nabal</hi> is no Natural, as appeares by the churliſh arguments he uſed againſt ſupplying of <hi>David. Who is David, and who is the ſonne of Jeſſe?</hi> He knew him well enough; for he knew his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage (which <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants did not tell him:) and ſo his interrogation, is not made as not knowing him; but as ſcorning him and his requeſt. The obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo that he maketh of ſervants breaking away from their Maſters, was a cloſe and malicious quip to <hi>David,</hi> for his flying from <hi>Saul. There be many ſervants now adayes that break away every man from his Maſter</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.10, 11</note>. <hi>Shall I then take my bread and my fleſh that I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be?</hi> Theſe words have weight in them, and not eaſily to be anſwered (if <hi>David</hi> were ſuch as <hi>Nabal</hi> would pretend him to be,) therefore, not the words of a natural. Yet the wicked fool cloathes himſelf under this Livery of a natural, and ſo thinks he may ſpeak of God what he liſt, becauſe forſooth, he knowes no better.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian laboureth under natural defects of the minde with a deſire to be rid of them, as <hi>David and his men kept on the other ſide of the mountain, making haſte to get away from Saul</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 23.26</note>: the unregenerate deſires to retain thoſe defects; and, to make ſhew of thoſe that are not in him, to cover that ſinfulneſſe with which he aboundeth: not unlike to <hi>David</hi> in another caſe<note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 20, 13</note>, <hi>who feigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mad, and ſcrabled on the doors, and let his ſpittle fall upon his beard;</hi> that he might not be found out to be what he was: the one looks upon ſuch defects as a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; the other, as a fence.</p>

                     <p>In regard of natural capacity he may be heavy and dull; but yet, in the things of God, he is taught by a Law <hi>that maketh wiſe the ſimple</hi>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 5.12, 13</note>. We ſee this in the very Apoſtles themſelves who underſtood not many of thoſe things which Chriſt preached unto them, although to them it were <hi>given to understand the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Acts 19.2</note>; yet without danger. For theſe were <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> as there appears; and, it was the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>the Spirit of faith</hi>

                     <p>A Chriſtian therefore that <hi>holdeth the foundation,</hi> may not come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome things, which yet are in him. And it fareth with him in point of quickneſſe of apprehenſion, as with many in the point of evidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love in Chriſt, to their ſoules. Aſſurance cannot be diſcerned in a fog, or miſt of tentation, ſpiritual deſertion, or grievous falls. Theſe for the preſent caſteth them into a ſwoon that ſeems to lay them for dead; ſo that they lie ſprawling for life upon the ground, having no ſenſe in themſelves that they are alive. So doth dulneſſe of capacity diſable a man to apprehend and know the things which the Holy Ghoſt hath undoubtedly wrought in him: which defect is, in many, very hard (if not impoſſible) to be cured: becauſe although qualities be alterable and altered by grace, yet not the natural conſtitution: in the room where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, faith comes and enables to believe whatever God ſpeaketh, though the believer cannot apprehend the reaſon or depth of what is ſpoken; and, makes him when he cannot hold argument or diſputes about the truth, to be able and willing to die for the truth. A great help hereunto, and to the ſufficient knowledge of what a Chriſtian yet apprehendeth not, is his ſincere obedience to the truth known. For, <hi>if any man be a doer of his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">John 7.17</note>, and thats enough, till God illighten him further to look into the bowels of the doctrine it ſelf to know what it is, as well as to know whoſe it is. Hence it cometh to paſſe that ſuch Chriſtians, who are later, and more weakly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are yet ſooner, and more perſwaded of the truth of the Goſpel, according to that prayer of <hi>Noah, God perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Memory is the Treaſurer of the ſoul: or, that ability or faculty in man which receiving ſtrong impreſſion of an Object, firmly retaineth it and layeth it up, that
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:63232:317"/> it may bring it forth again upon all occaſions, when called for. That which is moſt what looked upon as memory, <hi>is ſenſitive,</hi> which depends moſt upon the <hi>animal ſpirits,</hi> and the temperature of the <hi>brain,</hi> wherein, (that is, in the hinder part of the head, towards the ſpinal marrow, as in a place moſt retired, and leaſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) ſenſitive memory is ſeated. If the <hi>animal ſpirits</hi> be not quick and active, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe</hi> which apprehendeth, and the <hi>phantaſy</hi> which frameth an image or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the object in the brain, will be dull in their offices to lay in any thing, which memory ſhould retain. And, if the temperature of the <hi>brain,</hi> be not as it ought, the memory cannot hold what is laid up in it.</p>
                     <p>Some tempers do diſpoſe the brain to forgetfulneſſe; or at leaſt do indiſpoſe it to remembrance, making it futile, and fickle. If the brain be too moiſt and wateriſh, it is as wax boyling; which ſoon receives an impreſſion, but retaines it not, becauſe it is too thin and fluid; as we ſee in children, who quickly learn a thing, and as ſoon forget it (unleſſe it have ſomething of wickedneſſe in it, which ſinful corruption helpes to retaine in the heart:) if the brain be too hot and dry, it receives no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as hard wax before it be melted; ſo, the dry brain of age. There muſt be a proportionable degree of moiſture and heat, to receive an impreſſion, and alike proportion of dryneſſe and heat tempered with moiſture and cold, to enable the brain to retain what is imprinted in. Hence <hi>Plato</hi> concludeth, that it is hard to find a prompt wit and a ſtrong memory in the ſame man: becauſe the one requires a brain more <hi>hot and dry</hi> (yet not in extreames, for that cauſeth madneſſe;) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requires the brain more cold and moiſt: yet not too much of either, for that would breed dulneſſe, and blockiſh ſtupidity: which is the natural reaſon, why ſome are ſo dull of apprehenſion. This natural defect, wherever it happeneth, is a great affliction to divers of Gods dear children who would fain remember what they hear, but their ſive-like memory will not retain it. Yet God leaves them not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much remedy and comfort, as puts them into a better condition in point of memory, than the ſtrongeſt memory in the world that is meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                     <p>His memory, how weak ſo ever, is ſanctified, as well as his heart. So that, as Gods grace appeareth in making him careful and diligent in the uſe of means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what he cannot remember at once, by often hearing may be imprinted in his heart: So his heart being ſet on heavenly things, hardly forgetteth them, though other things paſſe away. For the edge of affection is apt to carve and make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the memory, of the things wherein a man delighteth. Thus, as the old man that loves money, hardly forgetteth his purſe; or the young man, his mirth and paſtime; ſo the children of God profeſſe <hi>the derſie of their ſoul</hi> to be <hi>to his name, and to the remembrance of him</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 26.8.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Yea, he maketh advantage of a weak memory, to forget and pack away follies, vanities, and injuries, and ſuch like as are not worth the keeping: as he that hath a running water by his door keepeth his houſe the cleaner, by conveying away of what otherwiſe would annoy him. By this means he that in caſes of this nature ſhould ſtudy the Art of forgetfulneſſe, (as once <hi>Themistocles</hi> deſired to do when one offered to teach him the <hi>Art of memory,</hi>) hath the oddes of others, in an eaſie forgetting of thoſe evils which he ought not to remember.</p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto, the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit that is graciouſly afforded to be his Remembrancer, who not only performeth the office of a Teacher <hi>to teach him all things;</hi> but, of a Prompter alſo, <hi>to bring all things to his remembrance whatſoever</hi> hath been <hi>ſpoken</hi> to him by Chriſt<note n="l" place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note>. So that, if his memory be weak; yet, by theſe additional and ſupernatural ſupplies it becomes beſt for the beſt things. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he that cannot perhaps relate the order and frame of a Sermon, yet he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſomewhat of the ſubſtance of it that may beſt ſtand him in ſtead, and hideth it in his heart. Or, if let it ſlip at preſent, yet he never gives over plodding and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon it, till he recall and recover it. Or, if he be not able to bring it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance by meditation at preſent; yet, when occaſion is of practiſing it to reſiſt tentation, to ſupport him in trouble, ſickneſſe, and to prepare him for death, it is
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:63232:318"/> a wonder to ſee how memory at ſuch times will ſerve and help him. He remembers beſt at his greateſt need: and he remembers to purpoſe, becauſe he is ever better for what he remembreth. His memory leaves him a better Chriſtian than it found him.</p>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 5.12.</note> may be unjuſtly charged upon his memory which is nothing elſe but the wickedneſſe of his own heart that hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, or his Word.</p>
                     <p>He is not onely unmindful of God<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 10.4.</note>, but laboureth to put God out of his mind, and to thruſt him from him, <hi>ſaying to God, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledg of thy wayes</hi>

                     <p>He is inclined unto evil, not onely becauſe the ſeedes of original corruption are in him, not wholly deſtroyed; but becauſe in ſome men the ſoyle, being more apt, maketh ſome of thoſe ſeeds to grow more rank. Philoſophers have obſerved ſome natures are more apt for vertue, as <hi>Brutus:</hi> others, more averſe, as <hi>Caſſius;</hi> of whom any wickedneſſe may be preſumed. As therefore there are ſome natural vertues; ſo, ſome vices are to ſome men natural, bred as we ſay, with the bone, and for that cauſe will hardly out of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>In like manner of ſome that are regenerate it may be ſaid, that to ſome vices, they are more prone than others to the ſame; or than themſelves to other evils: ſome are more given to deceit and ſtealing; ſome to uncleanneſſe, ſome to envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſome to covetouſneſſe, &amp;c. So that were it not for grace oppoſing thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, they would be dangerous members. And well is it for them that there is
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:63232:319"/> any thing of <hi>the Spirit luſting againſt the fleſh</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 5.17</note>, which ſtill endeavours to hold up a Law in the members warring againſt grace<note n="g" place="margin">Rom 7.23</note>.</p>
                     <p>But, however the Chriſtian be waſhed from that filthineſſe, in regard of the guilt and ſtaine, by juſtification; and in reſpect of the filth and power of it by ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; yet ſome tincture of that bad nature will remaine. He is in this caſe as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple borne under the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> which may change their habit, diet, behaviour, but not their colour and complexion: (and yet healthful black, is better than puling white:) He is black by his complexion and temper as having ſome ſpecial corruption that finds him more work, and gives him more trouble than any other member of the old man within him: yet, the truth of grace remaining ſtill in him, doth ſo keep down and maſter that corruption, that his ſpiritual comelineſſe is not taken away; but, at his worſt, makes him fairer in Gods eyes, than others that are not ſo much ſullied and ſpotted with that particular infirmity.</p>
                     <p>Nature indeed is a great help, where it is rightly tempered. There reaſon giveth direction, inclination, facility: and diligence brings forth what perfection nature can afford. But grace is above all, which giveth what it findeth not, and uſeth whatſoever it either findeth or giveth. It ordereth even reaſon it ſelfe, or rather giveth new reaſon where the old is defective. It transformeth nature ſo far as to <hi>cleanſe the heart</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 51.10</note>, and to make eaſie and familiar the way of obedience<note n="i" place="margin">Prov 8.9</note>. It giveth induſtry and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the ſluggiſh<note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 3.2</note>; and, unto all theſe, it addeth a bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note>Contrariwiſe, <hi>In the unregenerate, whatever evil was once bred in him, is ſtill acted by him without redreſſe, or remorſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The inclinations that are in him to particular evils, are cheriſhed and abetted: ſo as he gives them no check, upon the account of God or of grace. And therefore his thoughts are rather <hi>to make proviſion for the fleſh</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 13.14</note>, than any againſt it. And he not onely nouriſheth the inclinations, but purſueth the acts too, ſo far as may ſtand with his ſafety in the world: as we ſee in <hi>Cain, Eſau, Iſhmael, Pharaoh,</hi> and many moe, that being ſick of the dropſie of ſinne, rather make uſe of ſtrong water to feed and encreaſe it, than of phyſick to abate and cure it.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the impulſe of natural conſtitution and temper of body, ſhould be the matter of his ſorrow, he makes it the matter of his defence; thinking, if he have but skill enough to demonſtrate that the very temperative of his body naturally inclineth him to ſuch a vice, he hath ſaid enough to excuſe all the wickedneſſe that a corrupt heart can poſſibly put ſuch a natural temper upon. And albeit ſome vices may be in him in ſome part, and at ſome time corrected or ſtopped for a ſeaſon, yet that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>nature will returne again</hi> for want of the <hi>fork</hi> of grace to expel, and keep it off. And ſo that ſea of wickedneſſe which is in his heart, hath alwayes the ſame myre and dirt within it, although it doth not alwayes caſt it up.</p>
                     <p>Thus, as the miraculous wine which our Saviour made of water, was better than the natural<note n="m" place="margin">John 2.10</note>; and as the beſt apple-tree is that which is graffed upon a crab-tree ſtock; ſo where grace correcteth nature, it maketh it better than ſome other natures that wanted not ſo much correction. For grace correcteth the pravity, and helpeth the vigour of nature. But the unregenerate is as a veſſel that retaines his firſt liquor as well as ſavour: and as cloaths dyed of a ſcarlet colour, which are called <hi>Dibapha,</hi> twice died; once in the wool; and then, in the cloth, and therefore will hardly take any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour, or return to their firſt purity. The one is inclined to evil, over-powered by grace; the other ſuffers his natural corruption to make uſe of his natural defects as of a furious horſe to ride poſt to damnation.</p>

But mans preſumption againſt his Maker, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God juſt cauſe to ſuffer mans paſſions to perk up above both theſe guides and comforts of his life. For Phyloſophers, the Patrons of Reaſon, have diſcovered as much in the behalf of her; and grace in Gods children hath complained no leſſe, in behalf of her ſelf. Yet, with this difference; that Phyloſophy hath found out the diſeaſe, but not the cauſe: Grace hath diſcovered not only the cauſe, but the remedy alſo, as well as the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Paſſions and <hi>affections</hi> are uſually taken promiſcuouſly, becauſe, as water and ice, they mutually beget one another. Paſſion affects the ſoul: affections put the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to paſſion: and indeed, they are in a manner indiviſible; yet diſtinguiſhable. For, as in the <hi>minde,</hi> there is an <hi>intellectual</hi> memory, diſtinct from that which is properly <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive:</hi> ſo in the ſoul <hi>rational,</hi> there are certain affections rooted and ſeated in the Will, which are diſtinct from thoſe paſſions that are in the ſame ſoul as <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> which paſſions are not only ſeated in ſenſe, but in the body, and do in great part flow from the temperature of it; as the impetuouſneſſe of anger, and laſcivious <hi>lust,</hi> from the over-flowing of <hi>choller</hi> boyling the blood, and firing the ſpirits; as ſparks of fire ſtruck into the drieſt tindar.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not here enter a diſcourſe of the differences between the <hi>affections</hi> properly ariſing from the <hi>Will,</hi> as it is converſant about rational and ſpiritual objects, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by <hi>ſenſe;</hi> and thoſe paſſions and affections which ſpring from <hi>ſenſe:</hi> but ſpeak of both in the common acceptation of them, promiſcuouſly, as they are natural, and incident unto all men, as they are either painful, or become ſinful, and ſo are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments unto goodneſſe. For, albeit they appear in ſome more, in ſome leſſe: and ſome of them are more apparent in one; and ſome in another: yet they deſerve to be reckoned among things common, becauſe proceeding of nature, they might have been in all alike, if the tempers of ſeveral bodies had not differed one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                     <p>And where they are naturally more violent, ſuch, in whom they ſo prevaile, by courſe of nature cannot hinder it: where they are more moderate, no thank to him, as whom nature, not vice or vertue hath ſo tempered.

                     <p>Natural conſcience may ſometimes brawl and chide with the paſſions and affections when they ſhew themſelves too unruly; and reaſon may for a while argue the caſe with them, and be troubled by them. But they cannot trouble grace, which neither is, nor worketh in them. In which regard, the paſſions, eſpecially ſuch as are moſt ſtrong and violent, in the unregenerate are alwayes troubleſome to others: but ſeldome to themſelves: becauſe reaſon corrupted, depoſeth her ſelf; and, for the moſt part reſigneth her government unto paſſion. But grace, where that comes, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exerciſe, or contend for the maſtery over corruption, how often ſoever foiled and worſted by it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, paſſions and affections are in a Chriſtian like a head-ſtrong and skittiſh horſe, which he cannot be without, and therefore endeavoureth to manage to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of grace: but in the unregenerate they are as abſolute Lords which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage him to the moſt advantage of ſinne: to the one, they are as the <hi>fiery chariot</hi> that carried <hi>Elijah</hi> to Heaven: to the other, they be as the chariot of <hi>Jehu,</hi> or rather as <hi>Jehu, driving furiouſly,</hi> to the deſtruction of himſelf, as well as of others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The true Chriſtian, finding his paſſions and affections riſing high, makes them the matter <label type="milestone">

                     <p>The many <hi>Penitentials</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> entred upon Gods own record, and the bitter <hi>tears</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> (as authentically recorded as the former) ſufficiently demonſtrate the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which ſinful affections and paſſions produce in the godly.

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſ. 90.1</note>, declares no leſſe. For, however Interpreters generally take the ſenſe and ſcope of that prayer to be, the breathings of his ſpirit in relation to the miſeries and mortalities of that people whom he led through the wilderneſſe; yet, it cannot reaſonably be imagined, that ſo good, ſo holy a man ſhould forget to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the number, in reference to his own particular ſentence to be cut off for his infidelity and ſinful paſſion, as well as many of them had been already, before either they, or he ſhould enter <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                     <p>Even <hi>Moſes</hi> found by ſad experience, the cauſe and effects of unruly paſſion, which the higher it flies, the lower it layes and leaves the impotent patient. No prayers or tears of his, could ſo far prevaile, as to let him live till God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Deut. 3.25, 26, 27.</note>; or, ſo much as to let him have a ſight thereof; unleſſe from the top of a mountaine, at a very great diſtance<note n="*" place="margin">Above 240. miles, eaſt from <hi>Jebus;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                        </note>. The Chriſtian oft-times payes dearer, in this world, for his affections and paſſions, than worldlings do. And reaſon good: for, he hath more help againſt them, and brings more diſhonour to God by them<note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.14</note>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is not in his power properly to make them: for they are by nature, made to his hand. But, if they be not in him, he could finde in his heart to be unmade, and new made again, that he might not be without them. As the nimbleneſſe of bodily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the plenty of choller, ſo the variety and activity of ſinful motions in a man void of grace, is from the ſtrength of violent and turbulent paſſions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, egging him on to rebellion againſt God. Dulneſſe and lumpiſhneſſe in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is to him a great impediment to the corrupt iſſues of ſinful paſſions: therefore he had rather be ſubject to the moſt exorbitant paſſions, than be unactive in that way of ſinne to which his particular inclination more eſpecially drawes him.</p>
                     <p>Yea, he can be well content to be all luſts, and no natural affection: and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural luſts ſhould blot out all natural affection to parents, wife, children, countrey, &amp;c. that he may take his fill of ſinne, which to him is more deer than his neereſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the more he aboundeth in ſuch luſts and paſſionate affections, the more contentment he takes in them. Theſe he nouriſheth with as much care and ſtudy
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:63232:321"/> as if all his happineſſe conſiſted in them. For theſe he hath baits and lures, fancies, tales, pictures, Laws, that he not only obſerveth himſelfe, but impoſeth upon others under paine of his diſpleaſure and of cenſure of all generous ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>He hath rules and Laws for intemperance in eating, drinking, &amp;c. not like to thoſe of <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> given to the officers of his houſe to be obſerved by all at his royal feaſt, wherein albeit they had <hi>wine in abundance according to the ſtate of the King,</hi> yet <hi>the drinking was according to the Law</hi> (not of drunkenneſſe, but) of ſobriety; for, <hi>none might compel.</hi> But the unregenerate mans Laws are to the quite contrary: you muſt not deny to pledge any health, any way (how groſſe, or obſcene ſoever) that he begins it: you muſt do him right (as he calls it) as you are a friend, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp;c. although it be to the health of his whore.</p>
                     <p>So, he hath Laws of anger and revenge, even martial Laws of his own making, for bloody dwelling and revenge: as, what affronts deſerve the ſtab, the piſtol, the challenge: how the duel is to be fought, what is to be accounted ſatisfaction: how far, and when the ſeconds are to engage, &amp;c. All which, are the meere inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rules of the devil to engage men in wickedneſſe to their confuſion and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; expreſly contrary to the Laws of God againſt <hi>ſhedding of blood</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 9.6</note>, and <hi>taking revenge</hi>

                     <p>Thus, the Chriſtian findeth theſe violent paſſions in himſelf, as parents eſpie faults in their children which they grieve to finde, and endeavour to hide, as people do their uncomely parts: the unregenerate looketh upon them as characters of his worth wherein he glorieth, as being in ſport; the one no ſooner findeth theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in eccentrick motions, but he carefully reſiſteth; or at leaſt, ſlowly and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly followeth ſuch deſperate guides;<note n="*" place="margin">Hunc trabit invitam nova vic.—</note> the other is as the furious horſeman that whippeth and ſpurreth the too forward horſe, to the breaking of his own neck; the one covereth ſhame, the other exalteth folly.</p>

                        <hi>The Chriſtian willingly harboureth theſe untoward gueſts, ſo farre as they are natural.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>natural,</hi> underſtand, not the oppoſite to grace, but the deſperate vice. As the affections and paſſions are planted by nature, not byaſſed and drawn awry by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he willingly harboureth them. As they are perverted by ſinful corruption, ſo he makes a vertue of neceſſity and by grace improveth them to an uſe, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what ſinne intended, and over-powereth the violence of corruption, as a wiſe man taketh a ſword, or canon out of the poſſeſſion and command of the enemy, and turnes it againſt him.</p>
                     <p>He is no <hi>Stoick</hi> that under pretence of baniſhing all paſſions, as unworthy of a man, is void of all affections that ſhould make him ſerviceable to God, or man. Therefore he accounts himſelf beholding to God and nature for them. Originally, materially, and potentially they come from nature, being created by God, and planted in that ſoul which he himſelf inſpired into man. For though in the ſtate of innocency, only joy, and love, and ſuch like pleaſant paſſions were exerciſed. Yet where there was joy, there might be ſorrow, where there is love, there may be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that actually, and occaſionally, ſinne gave birth to them, as to their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. For, before man ſinned, he was naked without <hi>ſhame,</hi> and converſed with God <hi>(who is a conſuming fire</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12.29</note>) without <hi>feare.</hi> By ſinne alſo theſe <hi>paſſions</hi> have their courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> penally, as part of the puniſhment due to ſinne; as, in <hi>Adam,</hi> who after his fall, was both <hi>aſhamed,</hi> and <hi>afraid</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Gen 3.10</note>; and, for both, hid himſelf from God. Yea, they are abuſively, and too ordinarily, the inſtruments of ſin: for, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>wrath,</hi> in particular, that <hi>it worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Jam. 1.20</note>, it is too often verified of all other paſſions, that they are ſo far from working righteouſneſſe, that they are the main engines of Satan by which he hurryeth man upon ſo much unrighteouſneſſe and wickedneſſe againſt God.</p>
                     <pb n="623" facs="tcp:63232:321"/>
                     <p>But yet, by grace, they become weapons of righteouſneſſe, againſt ſinne, turning their enmity againſt grace, to an enmity and counterpoiſon againſt ſinne, as Art makes medicines of poiſons, cauſing the venome of herbs in the field to purge venomous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the body, as the ſcorpion cruſhed is made a plaiſter for her own wound. And, as the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> among other reaſons, were left in the land to deſtroy the wilde beaſts; or as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were employed to draw water, and for other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſervices of the Sanctuary; ſo theſe paſſions and affections are ſtill retained, notwithſtanding their ſinfulneſſe, in the choiceſt ſervants of God, to quicken and ſtirre up better qualities in them, and to make them more inſtrumental in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places and relations to glorifie God, by doing him more and better ſervice, than could poſſibly be performed without them.</p>
                     <p>Yea, being ſanctified, they little differ (in their uſe) from vertues, when rightly uſed; as, holy <hi>ſhame,</hi> godly <hi>ſorrow,</hi> religious <hi>feare,</hi> zealous <hi>anger, &amp;c.</hi> If therefore, for ſome reaſons, they deſerve to be expelled, becauſe, through ſin, they are of ſin, for ſinne, and at the command of ſin: yet for other reaſons they are worthy to be preſerved, becauſe they are of nature created, part of Gods image, or aſſiſtants to it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their uncomelineſſe: and, being by grace rectified, they become weapons of the new creature. Sharp, and dangerous weapons they are indeed. Yet as no wiſe man throws away his knife when it hath cut his fingers, or for-ſweares fire and gun-powder, becauſe he hath been ſcorched by them; but rather reſolveth to be more cautelous in the uſe of them; ſo doth a Chriſtian not caſt away, but more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep, and carefully uſe theſe paſſions that he may neither fall under the miſchief, nor want the benefit of them.</p>
                     <p>Contrarily, <hi>Some hypocrites and other Moraliſts ſeemingly, but wickedly wiſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Differ.</note> 
                        <hi>finding the paſſions troubleſome, have taught men to cut them off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old, and others after them, have hated paſſions; not becauſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but becauſe painful and troubleſome, by too much diſturbing their own eaſe, and laying too open their weakneſſes unto others: as if a man ſhould rather maime himſelf, than be troubled with a uſeful member. Indeed he that wanteth theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is maimed and defective not only in nature but in vertue. For, without affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is either no vertue at all, or elſe a very dull and lumpiſh vertue. It is as if, to keep men from going out of the way, one ſhould take off their chariot-wheels, or cut off the legges of their horſes; ſo taking away the means of motion, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aberration and errour in moving. Thus many a Prince imagining to take away an enemy, cuts off an uſeful friend or ſubject, for want of wiſdom to uſe him.</p>
                     <p>The hypocrite may talk much of an Heaven upon earth by being freed wholly from thoſe boiſterous windes and ſtormes of violent paſſions which ſome men ſuffer within themſelves; and, that the beſt way to be rid of them, is, to grub up the paſſions by the roots. Nor hath he any ſpiritual power or skill to improve them as the true Chriſtian doth: but he reſolves to uſe (not all but ſome of) them which trouble and ſhame him, as <hi>Saul</hi> did the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew, out of his pretended <hi>zeal for the children of Iſrael and Judah</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 21.2</note>; the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> being not <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> that by a wile had over-witted the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be not of the natives of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of a <hi>farre countrey,</hi> whereby they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a league with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael had ſworne unto them,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Joſhuah</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Joſh. 9.3.16, 17</note>. But God was angry with <hi>Saul</hi> and his houſe for this; and ſo will he be with theſe men; and that for more faults than this: for they that are ſo forward to kill theſe poor <hi>Gibeonites</hi> (which a <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> a true Chriſtian, would make good uſe of for the ſervice of the Sanctuary,<note n="f" place="margin">verſe 27</note>) are content to ſpare thoſe <hi>Amalakites</hi> of <hi>pride, ſelf-love,</hi> and <hi>vain-glory,</hi> which God would have to be utterly deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>To have nothing to do with theſe paſſions at all, is the ſtate of <hi>juſt men made perfect</hi> in heaven. It is enough to a Chriſtian here, if by grace he be able to maſter them, and to force them to be ſerviceable unto his Lord. Wilde colts and horſes, being tamed, are of great uſe to the owners: but paines muſt be taken with them; not to knock them in head, but to bring them to the bridle, ſaddle, pace, and hand,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:63232:322"/> and then they are every mans money. So is it with the paſſions. It is not warrant ſufficient to deſtroy them, becauſe they are naturally wilde, furious, and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: but more paines muſt be taken with them to bring them to hand and uſe, and to make them ſerviceable againſt ſinne that naturally are ſo inſtrumental to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and increaſe ſin in the hypocrite and unregenerate.</p>
                     <p>They cannot be worſe in their kinde, than the <hi>earth,</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, after his fall. <hi>The ground was curſed for his ſake, and in ſorrow was he to eat of it all the dayes of his life.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe it grew ſo full of <hi>thornes and thiſtles,</hi> which it <hi>brought forth unto him,</hi> that he was faine to <hi>eat his bread in the ſweat of his brows</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3.17, 18 19</note>, by labouring to make the earth uſeful and fruitful, that was ſo apt to yeeld thornes and weeds. <hi>Adam</hi> did not hereupon neglect or forſake the <hi>ground</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his care and labour; but, took the more paines with it, <hi>that it might bring forth herbs meet for them, by (and for) whom it is dreſſed,</hi> and thereby <hi>receive a bleſſing from God</hi>

                     <p>Thus the true Chriſtian is for the preſerving and improving the paſſions, as <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was for the preſerving of <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> ſought to deſtroy him; ſaying, <hi>wherefore ſhall</hi> they <hi>be ſlaine? what have</hi> they <hi>done</hi>

                        <hi>The unregenerate willingly ſubdueth his reaſon under his paſſion.</hi>

Herein is that of the wiſe man verified, <hi>I have ſeen ſervants upon horſes, and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.7</note>. A notorious indignity to ſee Paſſion Lord it in a Coach, and Reaſon, as a Lacquy footing it by his ſide. But now, new Lords, new Lawes. Paſſion reigning forceth Reaſon to deviſe Lawes againſt her ſelf. For without Reaſon they cannot be made, though they be made againſt Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Even in cold blood, he determineth to follow the commands of paſſion, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth reaſon, if it contradict this determination. He is herein as <hi>Caeſar</hi> that went ſoberly about the over-throw of the State, not for want of reaſon, but as reſolved not to hearken to it. So <hi>Cato</hi> kill'd himſelfe with great adviſement and ſhew of diſcretion. Thus men uſe all the Reaſon they have after an evil committed, to make good what paſſion hath done, that before trod it under
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:63232:323"/> foot of paſſion, when Reaſon offered to hinder the doing of it.</p>
                     <p>It is a part of the triumph of Paſſion, to force Reaſon <hi>ſuppariſitari,</hi> Paraſite-like, to maintain all acts of paſſion in the unregenerate. From hence proceed all ſtrained and profane Apologies for evil. Hence it is, that men adde <hi>thirſt to drunkenneſſe</hi>

                     <p>Thus, the regenerate have too much mixture of paſſion; the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, an habituated predominancy. The one gives way to paſſion, as fond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their children, who through over-doting affection love more and think better of their children than they deſerve, and ſo give them the reines more than is meet: the other, as blinde lovers, through rage of fancie, love where they ſhould hate, and like where they ſhould loath. In the regenerate, fancie as a <hi>Phaeton</hi> gets the chariot for a while: in the other, the cart alwayes guides the horſe, and the horſe the carter. Hence, the one, as <hi>David,</hi> bleſſeth the meanes by which he is ſtayed and reclaimed from giving further vent to his paſſion<note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 25.32 33</note>.

All paſſions corrupted are the ſtronger by corruption, while the man in whom they are waxeth weaker and weaker, as a man under a diſeaſe too hard for nature.

                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 32.9</note>. For uſually, where paſſion is ſtrong, reaſon is weak; and there, grace hath the harder task. Paſſion and Reaſon are the ſcales of the minde, as the one goeth down, the other goeth up. <hi>Jonah</hi> muſt confeſſe this to be ſo: for, neither the whales belly nor the ſea it ſelf could drown his paſſion of anger, even when he could expect nothing but the drowning of himſelf.

                     <p>This violence of the paſſions ariſeth much from bodily temper or diſtemper rather, and namely from <hi>melancholy,</hi> which is a tough and viſcous humour, to hold the impreſſions of paſſion. It is much alſo from education and liberty given to the follies of childhood and youth, without cruſhing in the egge, and nipping corruption in the bud. When children are uſed to have their will without curbing, correction, or reproof in their firſt ordering, ſuch, in ſhort time, grow ſo head-ſtrong, that afterwards they will hardly be governed by any Law; correction then comes too late, unleſſe to irritate corruption, and to make them more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and incorrigibly wicked.</p>
                     <p>Unto ſuch much grace is needful, and many prayers, and ſtrivings more than ordinary. In fine, there needeth an <hi>Alexander,</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> or ſtrong headed horſe. Yet are not ſuch paſſions to be wholly caſt away, or knockt in the head: foraſmuch as they (being once maſtered and renewed) may prove not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, but excellent. Even the <hi>Lion,</hi> the Beare, and the Wolfe (that is, men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as fierce, fell, rapacious, and violent, as thoſe bruits) are admitted into the Kingdom of Chriſt, and ſo tamed by the power of his grace, that they lie down with the <hi>Lamb, the Kid, and the Calſe</hi>

The tentations of Satan, the frauds and illuſions of wicked men ſhall be of more force with him, than any counſel from God.

It carries him on headlong with fury into all miſchief and miſery, as wilde and fierce horſes not weighed, nor under command, run away with a Coach to the hazard of the lives of all that are in it.</p>
                     <p>Such an one is unapt for counſel, and impatient of reproof. Yea, the more he is reproved, the more he <hi>hardeneth his neck,</hi> until he be on <hi>the ſudden deſtroyed, and that without remedy</hi>

When he ſeeth others as ready to follow God, and to expreſſe their forwardneſſe, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants when he was forced to flee from <hi>Abſalom</hi> (behold, thy ſervants are ready to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my Lord the King ſhall appoint<note n="k" place="margin">2 Sam. 15.15</note>) he himſelf is as lame <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> that <hi>cannot go with him</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">2 Sam. 19.26</note>: and is perhaps by ſome falſe-hearted <hi>Ziba</hi> (that ſhould aſſiſt him) traduced and ſlandered, as if he had ſome treacherous deſign againſt his Soveraign<note n="m" place="margin">Ver. 27</note>.</p>
                     <p>Some are naturally more ſtoical and diſpaſſionate than others. They are of an even diſpoſition, and ſo, take then when you will, whatever comes from them is much what like the ſound of a Bell, that alwayes yieldeth the ſame note. But yet they come behinde others in both duty; and comfort, the very ſenſe whereof cannot but much affect and afflict a true childe of God, as it did holy <hi>David:</hi> who was often troubled with his lumpiſh dulneſſe<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 43.5</note>.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, even herein he is not caſt off as an unfaithful ſervant, nor left without encouragement: but, the more he labours under this dull temper, the more he ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on God, to <hi>quicken him in his way</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 119.37</note>. And ſo he findes that <hi>the ſpirit is willing,</hi> even when <hi>the fleſh is weak,</hi> heavy, and ſleepy<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 26.41</note>. So that though he want the comforts that others more active do ſometimcs find, yet withal he is freed from ſundry diſcomforts that they meet withal: for, it much freeth him from exceſſes to which others are ſubject, and he comes as ſoon and faſt as he can to the Lord, although limping, as lame <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> to <hi>David</hi> with as true an heart as thoſe that are more forward.</p>

                     <p>He is dull, and inſenſible of it. He is in a ſad condition, and it is impoſſible to make him to take his caſe to heart. He is as one that ſleepeth on the top of a maſt, and feares no danger: yea, he pleaſeth himſelf in his affected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſluggiſhneſſe, and flattereth himſelf as being in the only good temper.

                        <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 19.15</note>, he is lumpiſh and like a dead man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perhaps when he is about ſome evil that pleaſeth his palate more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.

                        <note n="s" place="margin">Prov. 15.19</note>; it appears to him to be full of difficulties and dangers, as a path that is over-grown with briers and thornes.</p>
                     <p>He looks upon others of a quicker mettal and ſeeth them often to miſcarry, and ſtumble by their haſte, for which he deſpiſeth them. Hereupon he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fervencie and forwardneſſe in good duties, as exceſſes, and extremes not to be imitated, and applaudeth his own ſloth, as the only true even diſpoſition wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a wiſe man.

                     <p>Thus, the regenerate is as <hi>Jacob,</hi> after wreſtling with God, making what ſpeed he can<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 32.31</note>, although he be conſtrained to halt in going, not as unfaithful, but as unable to make haſte: the other is as the <hi>ſlothful in work, brother to him that is a great waſter</hi>

                        <note n="y" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5</note>. But as to the temper of his particular affections and paſſions, he is oft-times very variable and unconſtant.

                     <p>But, as it was ſaid of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he excelled both in vertues and vices, ſo ſuch though ſometimes they be more notorious in their falls, yet are they upon recovery more notable for their graces. As Lute-ſtrings, if they be true, though ſometimes, by being ſet too high or too low, they make an unpleaſing ſound, yet being put into a right pitch and tune, they yield a more than ordinary ſymphony and melody: ſo is it with a Chriſtian of this temper, although ſometimes, when out of tune, he offendeth the eyes and eares both of God and man, yet when he is again reduced to a good frame of ſpirit, he maketh excellent muſick beyond other men in the eares of both.</p>

                     <p>He often varieth his ſteps, but never his way. He goeth round as an horſe in a Mill: not from good to evil, for he was never good: not from evil to good, for he never meanes to be good: but only from one way, or kinde, or degree of evil unto another; from one ſin, errour, or humour to another. <hi>He gaddeth about</hi> with all earneſtneſſe, <hi>to change his way,</hi> as <hi>Judah,</hi> that ſought firſt to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> then to <hi>Egypt,</hi> for help againſt the <hi>Chaldean;</hi> but never, to get into Gods way, and therefore, with ſhame in both<note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 2.36</note>, becauſe ſtill, in the way of ſin.</p>
